"Atlassian Confluence Cloud","Confusing Restrict Page UI leads users to think their Edit button is wrongly missing","h2. Problem summary  The Restrict Page dialog can be mislead an administrator into thinking he/she has view/edit privileges when the admin is in fact restricted from doing so. This leads to confusion such as thinking that the Edit button is erroneously missing from a page.    h2. Scenario  Imagine a scenario where an admin has permissions to modify page restrictions, and goes to view a page which contains a page restriction. The admin is not currently page of list of privileged users that are allowed to edit the page, and notices that the Edit button is (correctly) missing. The admin then clicks the Padlock on a given page, and confusingly sees that his/her username is *already listed* among the other privileged users.    The admin thus believes a bug has been encountered (since the Edit button is missing) when really it's an issue with the Restrict Page dialog design. Consider the following two examples:    h2. Example 1 - When there are no page restrictions initially  * Create a page without any restrictions  * Log in as a user who can modify restrictions, and click the Padlock icon  * Change the dropdown to Viewing and Editing restricted. Observe that your username is automatically shown in the dialog below    In this example, it is easy for the user to understand that while the username is shown with Can view and edit, the changes are not committed until the Apply button is pressed. In other words, the dialog is showing you *what the restrictions config will update to if the Apply button is pressed*, rather than what is currently set for the page (which is nothing).    |Unrestricted page|What admin sees when clicking padlock and selecting  Viewing and Editing restricted in the dropdown|  |!unrestrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!norestrictions.png|thumbnail!|    h2. Example 2 - When there are already restrictions on the page  * Create a page and restrict editing to yourself (but allow everyone to view)  * Log in as a different user who can modify restrictions, navigate to the page and hit the Padlock button    In this example, there are already existing restrictions on the page. The Restrictions dialog shows everyone that is part of the existing restrictions, however (just like in Example 1) it _also_ shows the current who is not currently part of it. The dialog is once again showing what the restrictions config for the page will look like *if the Apply button is pressed.*    |Page with existing restrictions|What admin sees when clicking padlock|  |!restrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!existingrestrictions.png|thumbnail!|    This is a display problem is because the user, at this moment, is not actually part of the restrictions configs, and cannot edit the page. If the user presses Apply, that *will* in fact update the restrictions configs such that the user can edit the page afterwards. *The confusing part here is that there's nothing in the UI which clearly indicates what are the current settings, and what are the new changes that will occur if the button is pressed.*    In the case of Example 2, we can avoid this confusion by simply not auto-listing the current user viewing the Restrictions dialog, except when the user is factually part of the page restriction configs.",Bug,Low,"Gathering Impact","2019-04-04 20:48:33","2019-04-04 20:48:33",5

We ran into this when one of our customers exported a single page having a lot of multi-excerpt macros (those are static connect macros).   Calling the /contentbody/convert/export_view REST API apparently took longer than one minute so the gateway closed the connection.    This is a critical issue for us, because customers don't think of timeouts when adding (connect) macros on their pages.    *Steps to reproduce:*   # Install an addon providing a 'dummy' static content macro that sleeps three seconds (contact [~<EMAIL>] for this)    # Insert 20 of the dummy macros into a Confluence page. Alternatively, POST the following JSON containing twenty of these macros to {{<your- site>/wiki/rest/api/contentbody/convert/export_view}}       # You'll run into a '504 Gateway Time-out' after exactly one minute.    *Investigation Results:*     I think the problem is that currently the Confluence page waits for all macros on the page to send back a response before rendering all of them. Because of this, when one macro times out, the entire page cannot be rendered.    *Solution:*    Refer to <USER>s comment. ",Bug,Low,"Gathering Impact","2016-09-13 16:12:48","2016-09-13 16:12:48",5

However, Synchrony still has the old editor format.  This is also true for links and macros. For example, deleting a page that was linked to from another page results in this same behavior, as well as deleting a plug-in while one of its macros is used on a page. The page in edit mode still looks like the macro is present even though in view mode it shows up as Unknown macro.  *Workaround*  The workaround is to publish the page if this happens. Publishing the page forces Synchrony to get the new editor format. The editor format will now say correctly Unknown attachment or Unknown macro or will point to a non-existent link.

There is no logging at other levels either.  I suspect this began after implementing the Office Connector [canary process|https://<USER><USER>display/CONFKB/JVM+crashes+during+Import+from+Word+in+Confluence], however it could also have been due to the dependency changes required for plugins4.  Logging for the canary process and some parts of the Office Connector  (eg below) go to the catalina.out, but is not formatted in the usual way (eg the timestamp). This is because it uses an SLF4J SimpleLogger, which is by design - it runs in an entirely separate JVM and is stripped down to pure essentials. It appears as though the dependencies from this module are bleeding into the main JVM and breaking logging for the whole plugin. ",Bug,Low,Closed,"2016-05-24 22:35:13","2016-05-24 22:35:13",3

This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.  The obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox. We have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity. As a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.  The actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.

We should avoid overloading JIRA.  h3. Workaround:  Split out the JIRA Issues Macro onto separate pages.

The macro's icon itself is replaced with the word Icon.  In previous versions of Confluence (3.5.16, 4.3.3), the macros exported fine : icon on the left, text on the right, border and background color as expected. I wonder if this might come from the fact that the macros used to be displayed using an HTML Table tag, and now use a Div tag with CSS the place the icon.  This makes printing the documentation a pain, since the editor has to hunt for all the Icon mentions and rebuild the macros' Table tag and color. As an aside, this makes copy-pasting the content of a Confluence page in an HTML (or WYSIWYG) page a pain, since all the macro HTML tables are lost there too, replaced with Icon and plain text.  See attached files: * CaptureMacroTestConfluence.PNG: the macros as seen in Confluence 5.1.5. * CaptureMacroTestWord.PNG: the macros as seen in Word 2010.

My apologies for the may customers that were quickly impacted by this, we could have done a better job in communicating this and ensuring we had understood your needs with regards to this matter.   Since then we've received a lot of feedback to bring back pagination. Thank you for those of you who provided helpful comments below, and for those customers we have been able to speak to about this. With this in mind, we have concluded the following:  * It is very clear that the current issue limit we have is insufficient and does not meet most of your needs.  * It is important for you to be able to see _all_ the issues requested  * We still believe that the use case of navigating 100+ issues within inside Confluence is something that is extremely low and is something which should be done in JIRA.  * Some of you mentioned of the importance of seeing this also in PDF exports when you share the release notes or pages with customers.   With that in mind, what will we be doing to address this? 1. We will look at increasing the limit of the total number of visible issues 2. In addition, we will look at providing a parameter to configure this. *Note:* You will always be limited by the total amount of issues JIRA provides, but [this setting can be changed|https://<USER><USER>display/ONDEMANDKB/Changing+maxResults+Parameter+for+JIRA+REST+API]. 3.

This feature request is to help us better understand why customers want this.  If you are going to comment on this ticket, please provide some understanding for why you want pagination. We removed this feature because we saw very low usage of it. Since then, we've had a few requests to bring it back.   One way we could solve the majority use case is to increase the default amount of search results displayed. We are a bit hesitant to bring this back as we want to understand what it is that we are missing. If you are embedding 50/100+ issues on a page and want pagination, you probably shouldn't be doing that in Confluence, but rather the JIRA issue navigator - that is why we tell you there are xxx more issues, open in JIRA.   Please help us understand why you want this and some examples where you really do have lots of issues on a page that you want your end-users to read (if that is the use case) {panel} ",Suggestion,,Closed,"2013-07-26 06:29:56","2013-07-26 06:29:56",0
