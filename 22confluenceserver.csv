"Atlassian Confluence Server","Navigating through inline comments using the arrows breaks if navigation hits an inline comment on a text warn/info macro","h3. Issue Summary  Given a Confluence page with a lot of content and has inline comments, navigating between the inline comments will glitch, should the following conditions are met:  # The page contains a warn/info macro with inline comments.   # The above macro is located at the area of page that requires the user to scroll down to view it. (The issue does not happen if the macro is located at the top of the page)  When navigating through all the inline comments using the top and bottom arrows on the left side of the inline comment section, the navigation glitches when you hit the inline comment that is located in the warn/info macro.    In normal cases, when a user navigates through the inline comments the page will auto scroll to the text referred to by a specific inline comment. However, in the case of this bug, Confluence will not scroll to the text referred to by the inline comment in the warn/info macro. Instead Confluence, will auto scroll to the top of the page.       h3. Steps to Reproduce  # Create a page in Confluence with a lot of content. The content needs to be enough, so that you need to scroll down when viewing the page.   # At the bottom of the page, add an warning macro   # Add a text inside that macro and add some inline comments to the text.  # Add inline comments in the various areas of the page.   # Save the page.   # Click on any of the text with inline comment  # Navigate through the comments using the arrows on the top right side of the inline comment.  # Navigate until you reach the info/warn macro's inline comment.    h3.

Actual Results  # The browser will move to the top of the page.   # The inline comment will still be displayed at the same level where the info/warn macro is.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Subscribing to Team Calendars in Confluence with events from restricted or inexistent Jira projects might fail","h3. Issue Summary  Confluence users can subscribe to Team Calendars and get an updated list of events from Confluence in their preferred calendar _app_ as described in [Subscribe to and from Team Calendars|https://confluence.<USER>teamcal/subscribe-to-and-from-team-calendars-273285883.html].  If users subscribe to a Calendar that has events from a restricted or an inexistent Jira project (see [Add Jira Events|https://confluence.<USER>teamcal/add-jira-events-241566244.html] for further information), then Confluence will throw an error instead of gracefully bypassing events associated to that project.    h3. Steps to Reproduce  # Install a vanilla instance of Jira Software.   #* This was validated with Jira Software 7.9.2 but should not be tied to a specific Jira version.  # As the Jira administrator, create a sample project.   ## Go to *Projects* > *Create project* > *Create sample data*.   ## Select *Project management* and click on *Next*.   ## Use the following information to create the project: _Name_: {{Test Project}} ; _Key_: {{TSTPRJ}}; _Project Lead_: {{jira administrator}}  # Restrict the _Browse Projects_ permissions just to Jira administrators, removing the permission to any logged user.  # Create a regular Jira user, which is added just to the {{jira-software-users}} group.   #* _username_: {{user001}}  # Install a vanilla instance of Confluence.   #* This was validated with Confluence 6.13.3 but should not be tied to a specific Confluence version.  # [Install Team Calendars|https://confluence.<USER>teamcal/install-team-calendars-241566248.html].   #* This was validated with Team Calendars 6.0.37.  # Create a regular Confluence user, which is added just to the {{confluence-users}} group.   #* _username_: {{user001}}  # Create an application link between Confluence and Jira.  # Create a blank space: _Space Name_: {{Test-Team-Calendars}}; _Space Key_: {{TTC}}  # Go to {{<Confluence Base URL>/display/TTC/calendars}} and add a new calendar.   #* _Name_: {{Test Calendar}}  # Within _Test Calendar_, click on *...* > *Add event*.   #* Select _Event Type_: {{Jira Issue Dates}}; _Name_: {{Test Project Calendar}}; _Display_: {{JQL (advanced)}}; _JQL_: {{project = Test Project}}; _Show_: {{Issue Created Date}}   #* At this point the events are added and the administrator has visibility to the events in the calendar.   # As {{user001}} access {{<Confluence Base URL>/display/TTC/calendars}} and click on _Subscribe_.   #* Choose _Calendar_: {{Test Calendar}}; _Calendar app_: {{iCal}}  # Copy the _Team Calendars URL_ and paste it in the browser.    h3. Expected Results  A pop-up is given by the browser so the user can download an _.ics_ file.  Confluence gracefully handles the fact the Jira project is restricted and doesn't include events from this sub-calendar, but still shows events from other sub-calendars.    h3. Actual Results  Confluence answers with HTTP 500 status and with a {{java.lang.NullPointerException}} to the user.  An error similar to the below is logged in {{atlassian-confluence.log}}:      The user is unable to subscribe to the Calendar.    h3. Notes  The same problem occurs if the target project is unrestricted in Jira, but had its name/key changed after the calendar was created in Confluence, invalidating the JQL query.    h3. Workaround  There's no straightforward workaround to the _subscribe use case_ and still keep the original data in Confluence.  The problematic JQL can be determined by the error in Confluence log.  One of the following options can be used with their possible consequences:   * If the Jira project was renamed, then search for the Calendars pointing to it and update the JQL filter.   * If the Jira project was removed, then search for the event pointing to it and remove it.   * If the Jira project is restricted to certain users, removing it from a _public_ calendar may be an option to certain use cases.    If applicable, exporting the calendar to an _.ics_ file as explained in [this KB|https://confluence.<USER>teamcal/export-team-calendars-content-to-other-calendars-240913738.html] still works.

However, if your custom field is configured so that the issue types associated with the default configuration of the custom field is _not_ to all issue types available, then the custom field won't appear in the TC Create event dialog.

Here's the KB:   - [https://confluence.<USER>confkb/creating-new-page-or-space-loads-forever-744329880.html]    This was caused by the space blueprints table AO_54C900_SPACE_BLUEPRINT_AO containing a reference to a blueprint that was no longer available.

Notes    The installation method that triggers this situation is a workaround for the following bugs:   # https://jira.<USER>browse/CONFSERVER-57792   # https://jira.<USER>browse/CONFSERVER-57541    After running this installation method and rebooting the computer, we end up having two entries on the registry that trigger the app startup, one under the key *HKEY_CURRENT_USER* and the other under *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE*.    Even though this is not triggered under normal circumstances, the idea of this bug is that one of the following situations must be avoided:   # The app should check if it is already running before starting a new process, or   # If the possibility of having two processes is expected, the secondary process should not leak memory    If the app has one of those protection mechanisms bundled, we exclude the possibility of compromising the end-user computer resources.  h3. Workaround 1    Remove one of the registry entries (either from HKLM or HKCU tree), which can be done by an administrator. Only one of the following entries must exist in the registry:      (!) For a 64 bit OS, the registry tree looks like this:    h3. Workaround 2    Uncheck the *Launch at startup* box on the app itself, which can be done by the end user.

Problem  Adding new Calendar in Page using Team Calendar Macro might fail if the user belongs to too many groups and the space has a lot of calendars within itself.  The macro will search for all group memberships and eventually hit the threshold that is set and the warning message below is thrown in the log:  {code}   [http-nio-8081-exec-4] [confluence.util.profiling.DefaultActivityMonitor] close Exceeded the threshold of 60000 ms   {code}  (i) This threshold is not able to be extended due to the block at CONFSERVER-36883     When creating a new calendar through the Team Calendar Macro, Confluence do a bunch of permission checks for each of the existing subcalendars within the space. The server returns a complete object with all of the sub calendars within the space which is necessary for processing on the front-end. This can be seen below (AbstractSubCalendarResource#toExtendedSubCalendar), this is performed when the user clicks Add new Calendar  {code:java}  private SubCalendarsResponseEntity.ExtendedSubCalendar toExtendedSubCalendar(PersistedSubCalendar subCalendar, ConfluenceUser forUser)   {   UtilTimerStack.push(CalendarResource.toExtendedSubCalendar());   try   {   return new SubCalendarsResponseEntity.ExtendedSubCalendar(   subCalendar,   calendarPermissionManager.hasViewEventPrivilege(subCalendar, forUser),   calendarPermissionManager.hasReloadEventsPrivilege(subCalendar, forUser),   calendarPermissionManager.hasEditSubCalendarPrivilege(forUser),   calendarPermissionManager.hasEditEventPrivilege(subCalendar, forUser),   false,   false,   false,   calendarManager.isEventsOfSubCalendarHidden(subCalendar, forUser),   calendarPermissionManager.hasDeleteSubCalendarPrivilege(subCalendar, forUser),   calendarPermissionManager.hasAdminSubCalendarPrivilege(subCalendar, forUser),   new HashSet<SubCalendarsResponseEntity.ExtendedSubCalendar.PermittedUser>(   Collections2.transform(   calendarPermissionManager.getEventViewUserRestrictions(subCalendar),   new UserToPermittedUserTransformer(userAccessor, settingsManager)   )   ),   calendarPermissionManager.getEventViewGroupRestrictions(subCalendar),   new HashSet<SubCalendarsResponseEntity.ExtendedSubCalendar.PermittedUser>(   Collections2.transform(   calendarPermissionManager.getEventEditUserRestrictions(subCalendar),   new UserToPermittedUserTransformer(userAccessor, settingsManager)   )   ),   calendarPermissionManager.getEventEditGroupRestrictions(subCalendar),  // getSubCalendarWarnings(subCalendar),   new HashSet<String>(),   false //reminder   );   }  {code}    Within a few of these hasPrivilege methods, if the user is not the creator of the subcalendar, Confluence check Admin group membership for the user {{isUserMemberOfOneGroup(user, CONFLUENCE_ADMINISTRATORS_GROUP_NAMES)}} which gets all of the user's groups and checks if the Admin group is contained within that list. This uses the method    DefaultUserAccessor#getGroupNames, which calls the following method to performs the permissions check:  {code:java}  public List<String> getGroupNamesForUserName(String userName) {   return (List)(userName == null ? Collections.emptyList() : ImmutableList.copyOf(this.crowdService.search(QueryBuilder.queryFor(String.class, EntityDescriptor.group()).parentsOf(EntityDescriptor.user()).withName(userName).returningAtMost(-1))));   }  {code}    So in summary, for every subcalendar, Confluence may have to retrieve all of the groups that the user belongs to *multiple times*.       h3. Suggestion  Since it will be retrieving the same groups every time, we should be able to improve the performance by adding some simple caching.     h3.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Companion App MSI should automatically startup on next login after install","h2. Problem Definition    Currently when the Companion App MSI file is deployed by admins wishing to roll out this feature to multiple Windows machines the app still needs to be manually started before it can make the system call to add it to launch at startup. Customers have run into this issue and see that only after running the app manually the registry entry is placed here: {{HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run}}    This differs from the normal installer behaviour (.exe) which does launch the Companion App after installing. However, MSIs are usually installed via an admin account, so having the executable launch automatically after installation will not solve the problem (as this will only add the registry entry for the admin user).   h3. Current scenario:    After user runs the App for the first time, the registry key will be added in the following path    h2. Workaround:    The registry key can be added to HKCU (for all users that should have Companion running) during the deployment to ensure that the app is started automatically without having the user to start it manually.    For 32-bit OS:    For 64-bit OS:         As of Companion 0.6.0, a registry key can alternatively be manually added to HKLM (instead of HKCU) with no side effects. This will allow Companion to automatically launch for all users on the machine.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Macros nested inside other macros are corrupted if original macro is disabled or not installed","Confluence will corrupt nested macros inside a unknown macro, leading to data loss in the page storage. The bug lies in the XhtmlContent's implementation and what the class does when a macro definition does not exists or it's not available.    When the xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions method is called with a block of xhtml content which contains a reference to a macro module that has been disabled it will return invalid data - such that it ignores the macros that the disabled macro contains and will conflate the parameters of those macros into the disable MacroDefinition.    xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions will generates invalid data leading to data loss.    In the page we will see this image:   !image1.png|thumbnail!   And if we edit the page, nothing will appear inside the macro:   !image2.png|thumbnail!     The storage format shows that the data exist in the page and the following error appears in the logs:      h4. Replicating the issue    The info above is the standard info macro and simple macro was a test macro created to just return the body.    When this situation arises, a call to xhtmlContent.handleMacroDefinitions will result in the first MacroDefinition passed to the MacroDefinitionHandler.handle method being corrupted - the MacroDefinition will have no body, and all of the parameters of the child macros will be conflated into the corrupt definition.    On the event, this bug caused the F4C (Forms for Confluence) migrator to attempt to migrate the content based on invalid data, and thus corrupted the pages.    In the test, if we used the following storage format:    With both Simple-macro and other-macro enabled, we get these results from the test plugin (which iterates across the macro definitions found by XhtmlContent and outputs the parameters and values)        However, if the other-macro have it's module disabled, we see that the warn macro content disappears and the arguments are conflated ito the other-macro definition.    This will cause data loss on all pages that uses the disabled macro and a separate macro migration tries to use the XhtmlContent to convert markup to MacroDefinition objects so that they can be adjusted and then reformatted out to migrate the content to the new format.    h4.

For example,   *Does not work:* C:\Users\user name\AppData\Local\atlassian-desktop-companion\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login   *Works:* C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\atlassian-desktop-companion\Atlassian Companion.exe --was-opened-at-login    This seems to be a Windows issue, since it should be able to launch the app, even if the path has spaces in it, but it just does not work on certain Windows install for some reason.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","OAuth - Service Provider - Session Remover Job is broken","(!) This issue does not affect Data Center users. Confluence Data Center is currently able to run the clean-up job without problems.    h2. Issue Description  There's a scheduled job executed by Confluence job handler called {{Service Provider Session Remover}} accountable for removing expired OAuth tokens from {{BANDANA}} table. This job is not working properly, and expired tokens are not being cleared as expected. With enough expired tokens in the database, this can eventually lead to an {color:#ff0000}application crash{color} as the logic to handle tokens is negatively impacted by the number of expired and useless entries stored in the database.    h2. Steps to Reproduce  # Set up JIRA + Confluence applinked together through an OAuth relationship  # Add Confluence gadget feed to JIRA  # Create new JIRA Dashboard and add Confluence Page Gadget, do *not* Login and Approve  # Every time the Dashboard/Gadget is loaded, observe that a new {{com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.<somestring>}} row gets added in BANDANA table in Confluence, e.g.:  {code:title=bandanakey}  com.atlassian.oauth.serviceprovider.ServiceProviderTokenStore.token.5IWZaCCOpzibZTUboRNaJU5WmddxePSe  {code}  {code:title=bandanavalue}   <properties>     <property name=token value=dqgAd6Oc9JU2G4ZuM6ec0PLmkIMf670w/>      <property name=creationTime value=1521048328968/>      <property name=tokenSecret value=ZAN3c7Yu6zEP8pUQVWB25e5odUrsRNbi/>        <property name=authorization value=NONE/>      <property name=version value=V_1_0_A/>     <property name=properties value=      xoauth_app_url=http\://confluence.example.com/rest/gadgets/1.0/g/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.gadgets\:confluence-page-gadget/gadgets/confluence-page-gadget.xml   />      <property name=type value=REQUEST/>        <property name=callback value=http://jira.example.com/plugins/servlet/gadgets/oauth-callback/>      <property name=consumerKey value=jira:2f5ae229-2135-43a8-bfd4-77f1cd14b3cc/>       <property name=timeToLive value=600000/>     </properties>  {code}  # Load the JIRA Dashboard and Gadget several times and observe there are now several such entries in the BANDANA table.  # Leave Confluence running for 8 hours or more to ensure {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs. It will not and you will be able to see evidence on logs that it has failed to execute. You should have an entry like the one below:  {code}  runJob Scheduled job CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobRunnerKey.Service Provider Session Remover#CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover completed unsuccessfully with response JobRunnerResponse[runOutcome=ABORTED,message='Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY'].  {code}    h2. Expected Behavior  The {{Service Provider Session Remover}} runs every 8 hours and clears out the OAuth tokens from BANDANA    h2. Actual Behavior  The {{Service Provider Session Remover}} attempts to run every 8 hours but is aborted. The {{scheduler_run_details}} table shows:  {code}     id    |                               job_id                                |       start_time        | duration | outcome |                 message                   ---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------+---------+-----------------------------------------    428282 | CompatibilityPluginScheduler.JobId.Service Provider Session Remover | 2018-03-27 02:56:11.413 |        6 | A       | Job has unexpected run mode RUN_LOCALLY  {code}    h2. Technical details  The above means that if the dashboard is loaded 1000 times, there will be 1000 such entries in the database. These tokens are supposed to be cleared from {{BANDANA}} via the scheduled job {{Service Provider Session Remover}} which runs every 8 hours, however the job is currently broken.    As expired/unused tokens are not removed, instances will eventually hold a huge number of tokens in their database. Due to the logic used in the [OAuth Plugin|https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlassian-oauth] and documented in [OAUTH-321|https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/OAUTH-321], as the number of tokens in the database grows, so does the complexity of the problem it needs to resolve. This is because when inserting a new token to the database, it will iterate through a list of existing tokens to validate each one of them before inserting a new one.    The intent of this logic is to validate duplicated entries as well as keep the list of usable tokens up to date, however, as the set of data ( n ) that the algorithm needs to resolve gets bigger, so does the complexity of the problem, which demands more computational resources to get resolved, making the algorithm an O (n²) [complexity class|http://bigocheatsheet.com/] one, leading to eventual outages depending on the instance usage and available resources.    h2. Symptoms  The Confluence instances that run into the performance/stability problems due to high number of stored OAuth tokens will observe one or more of the following symptoms:   * High CPU Usage.   * High Memory Usage.   * A huge number of entries in {{BANDANA}} table related to {{Service Provider}} tokens.

After this is done, you should no longer observe the symptoms caused by this issue, however, users may be prompted to re-authenticate against applications that were relying on the OAuth tokens previously stored in the database once the clean-up is completed.    It is important to highlight that this workaround may need to be repeated from time to time until this bug is solved if symptoms re-occur. Instance administrators may want to setup a trigger in their database clients to execute this routine automatically based upon certain circumstances, like for example, {{BANDANA}} table going full of records if they intend to automate this task.",Bug,High,Closed,"2018-03-28 19:18:24","2018-03-28 19:18:24",5

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Frequent deadlocks on the scheduler_run_details table can cause an outage","{panel:title=Resolution|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}  A [Scheduled Job|https://confluence.<USER>doc/scheduled-jobs-96567525.html] called 'Purge Old Job Run Details' has been introduced to purge scheduled job history    {panel}    h2. Summary    Frequent deadlocks on the scheduler_run_details table can cause an outage.    The scheduler_run_details table holds the job execution history for both clustered and non-clustered jobs. When a deadlock occurs on this table it prevents the job history from being updated and eventually leads to an outage.  h2. Environment   * Confluence Data Center   * Confluence server Standalone   * Microsoft SQL Server   ** Transaction isolation level [READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT|https://confluence.<USER>doc/database-setup-for-sql-server-9258.html]   ** [Collation|https://confluence.<USER>confkb/how-to-fix-the-collation-of-a-microsoft-sql-server-confluence-database-687216725.html] has been verified correct   * MySQL database   * PostgreSQL database   * Large number of records in the scheduler_run_details table    h2. Symptoms  h4. Application logs      (i) The job name and ID will vary, as this can happen to any non-clustered job in the Confluence cluster.  h4. DB logs    The DB error logs will look similar to what you see here:    Confirm if there is table scanning by running an execution plan against the delete queries - see [Displaying Graphical Execution Plans (SQL Server Management Studio)|https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178071(v=sql.105).aspx] from MS documentation for details of how this can be done in your environment.  h2. Details of the problem    It is possible that multiple nodes are updating the table concurrently, because the table is not for clustered job.    The current implementation of SchedulerRunDetailsDao increases contention as it does purge (delete outdated job details) every time when a new record is added to the table:      Normally, the database should be able to handle these kind of concurrent transactions (as we are deleting things rather than updating the same record). However, it is not handled perfectly by MS SQL Server or MySQL. The situation is escalated and one transaction is chosen to be rolled back as a deadlock victim. This may lead to other symptoms.    These are two queries frequently being deadlocked:    The lack of the indexes is very likely to cause a full table scan during the execution of the delete statements. Adding the indexes in the workaround should significantly reduce the chance of deadlocks.    And another thing is, the design of addRunDetails is not optimal. The purge should be implemented as a cluster wide job rather than part of the add logic. It would eliminate contention completely. Or at least it should be made less frequent (on a daily basis, for example).  h2. Workaround  h4. Option 1    Add the following 2 composite indexes to the SCHEDULER_RUN_DETAILS table, based on the predicates of the two delete statements.    h4. Option 2    After performing the above, deadlocks are still possible if the size of the table is very large (i.e. over 100k rows) due to the frequency of the purge request.    You can try deleting entries in the scheduler_run_details older than 1 day. The SQL query to do this would be something like below, replacing the date with one day ago:    (!) *Important:* You should not run this in production without first testing in your staging environment. You should also take a database backup or dump prior to running this in production. If anything does not work as expected, you can then restore from the backup.    h4. Option 3    You may also try to apply one of the below DB changes:   # Disable lock escalation for the table scheduler_run_details   # Disable page lock for the table scheduler_run_details    The final option would prevent the possibility of a deadlock caused by concurrent purges. Since the purged jobs are obsolete, this shouldn't be a problem.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Logs flooded excessively with Hazelcast instance is not active! once Hazelcast has shut down","h2. Problem description  In a Data Center configuration, if Hazelcast is shut down on a node (e.g. in a cluster panic) the logs are quickly flooded with stacktraces like the below:      These stacktraces are recorded at the rate of tens/hundreds of times per minute and can quickly fill up the default log configuration of ~120 MB of atlassian-confluence.log files with nothing but these entries. The logs can roll in a matter of minutes.    The reason this is a problem is that it can cause the root cause of the node shutting down (e.g. the cluster panic event) to be rolled off the logs way before administrators have a chance to react/intervene to recover the node or manually pull the logs before rolling off. In other words, this flood of logging can hamper efforts for root cause analysis for large clients.    Ideally, we can log this type of stacktrace *once* and minimize the verbosity future entries of a similar type instead of repeatedly logging the stacktrace.    h2. Workaround  The current workaround is to extend the default logging so that more logs are kept in archive, in order to give administrators a greater window to capture the relevant logs. This can be done my modifying the following two parameters in <confluence_install>/confluence/WEB-INF/classes/log4j.properties, which influences size of log files and number of logs kept in archive, respectively:      Note however that increasing the logs kept will impact the disk footprint and size of Support Zips generated.",Bug,High,Closed,"2017-08-15 10:35:43","2017-08-15 10:35:43",3

This happens because the template uses the DNS to mount the EFS into the new Confluence Node, so the two conditions on EC2 to use the EFS via DNS are:  # The connecting EC2 instance must be inside a VPC and must be configured to use the DNS server provided by Amazon.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","When importing a word document, header order is not respected","h3. Summary  When importing a word document and splitting by headers, the page tree that gets created is alphabetized. What we are expecting to happen is that the page tree would be in the same order in which the headers appear in the document.    To reproduce, simply import a word document which can be split by multiple headers that do not appear in alphabetical order within the document. Once the document is imported, notice that the page tree is alphabetical in order as opposed to their order within the document.    I have attached an example Word document to test with.    h3.

It has been a complicated one to solve and we wanted to include a few notes on this fix we have shipped in the 6.15.5 release.    *Adding new emoticons (including Hipchat emoticons) to a page:* This is now fixed. They will be saved in valid storage format (e.g {{<ac:emoticon ac:name=smile/>}} for standard Confluence emoticons or {{<ac:hipchat-emoticon ac:shortcut=name/>}} for Hipchat emoticons).  *Existing pages with invalid emoticons and collaborative editing turned OFF:* Viewing or editing the page will display fixed emoticons. Saving the page will correct the storage format of the broken emoticons.  *Existing pages with invalid emoticons and collaborative editing turned ON:* Viewing the page will display fixed emoticons. If there is a current draft with broken emoticons, then the broken emoticons will be displayed once in the editor. On the next save of the page, any invalid emoticons will be fixed.      *For those using Hipchat emoticons*, please note:    If an invalid Hipchat emoticon has the same name as one of the standard Confluence emoticons (such as smile, thumbs-up or tick), it will be converted into the corresponding Confluence emoticon once the page is saved.      For all cases, saving the page will fix the broken emoticons. We explored the possibility of including a front-end editor fix to automatically resolve all of these broken emoticon instances. As it would involve checking every page and have an ongoing performance impact, we decided against doing this. So, if you come across any broken emoticons, please edit and update/publish your page to resolve the problem.        Thanks again for your understanding.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Links containing certain encoded special characters become double-encoded","This ticket stems from -CONFSERVER-45966-. In that ticket, if you enter a link that contains url-encoded characters such as %25 or %2f, <USER>, those characters became double-encoded.    The resolution in CONFSERVER-45966 resolved most of these characters including all umlaut and cyrillic characters per the description of that ticket.    The problem is that there are certain characters which when encoded in the link are still being double encoded.    Those characters are: ; , / ? : @ & = + $. The encoded versions of these characters are: %3B %2C %2F %3F %3A %40 %26 %3D %2B %24 and if the link contains any of the encoded version, that character will be double-encoded.       h3. Workaround    Option 1: Paste the link into the editor instead of using insert link dialog.   * In this method you cannot modify the link text, so the link text will be automatically set based on the url    Option 2: Use square brackets to insert the link. [ ]   # Type [   # Type the text you want for your link in the editor, for example My Link   # Type a |   # *Type* the url   # Type ] to complete the link.   # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.   # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link. If you do, the link will be double-encoded.    For step 4, you could also try pasting the url but this might have less success since the url will be converted to a link automatically and you might have to first undo that automatic conversion, which in turn may cause the closing ] to have no effect. See option 3 instead.    Option 3   # Paste the URL into the editor.   # Press undo to undo any automatic link creation/extraction so you see the original URL.   # If the URL is still a link, click it, and click Unlink to return it back to regular text.   # At the beginning of the link, type [ followed by `Escape` to exit the Link Autocomplete   # Type the text to display for the link followed by |   # Now your link should look like this   ## !Screen Shot 2017-05-11 at 7.37.39 AM.png|width=379,height=48!   # Click at the end of the link and type ] to complete the link. This should auto-convert it to a link with the desired text.   # Save or preview the page to confirm it works.   # *Important!* Don't open the link dialog for this link. If you do, the link will be double-encoded.         Option 4: Using the Source Editor to change links after adding them   # Install the [Confluence Source Editor|https://marketplace.<USER>plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.editor.confluence-source-editor/server/overview] (free add-on)   # Edit the page   # Click on the {{<>}} icon in the top right   # Find the *href=* attribute that contains the '%25' in the URL   # Replace it with just '%'   # Apply the changes and save the page",Bug,High,Closed,"2017-05-15 23:22:32","2017-05-15 23:22:32",0

Summary    Upgrade Confluence (connected to Oracle 12c) to version 6.1.x failed with the following error in the logs (atlassian-confluence.log) :    h5. Analysis    Running the following query in the database found out that Confluence is taking up ~600 open cursors :      h5. Cause  This is a known bug with Oracle JDBC driver version 12.1.0.2, which leaks database cursors. See this Oracle Community forum post for more information: https://community.oracle.com/thread/3682300.     h5. Workarounds    See [this KnowledgeBase article for detailed instructions|https://confluence.<USER>confkb/upgrade-to-version-6-1-x-failed-with-error-ora-01000-maximum-open-cursors-exceeded-922914154.html].    There are two known workarounds for this issue:    *1. Update the Oracle JDBC Driver to the latest version (12.2.0.1)*  There is a new version of the Oracle JDBC driver which fixes the cursor leak. Updating your driver prior to upgrading Confluence to 6.1.x will prevent this issue.  To update the driver:  # Stop Confluence, and create a backup of the installation and home directory.  # Download version 12.2.0.1 (or later) of the driver from the Oracle JDBC Driver page.  # Replace the existing ojdbc7.jar in <Confluence installation>/confluence/WEB-INF/lib with the new driver. For detailed instructions, follow step 6 in the database setup for oracle page.  # Start Confluence.  # Re-attempt upgrade.    *2. Increase Maximum Open Cursors*  Increase the maximum open cursor in the database :    (i) The query above is obtained from [Side Bar Is Not Visible Due To Not Sufficient Open Cursors In Oracle|https://confluence.<USER>confkb/side-bar-is-not-visible-due-to-not-suficient-open-cursors-in-oracle-780863319.html].

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Images, attachments, user mentions are broken after changing the BaseURL","{panel:title=Atlassian Update - March 2018|borderStyle=solid|borderColor=#3C78B5|titleBGColor=#3C78B5|bgColor=#E7F4FA}  The fix for this issue released in 6.8.0 will prevent links to images (and view attachment macros) from being corrupted after a change in the Confluence baseURL.    However, if there are any existing link corruptions that occurred prior to upgrading to 6.8.0, those corruptions will remain, and the only way to fix is to either revert to a published version of a page without such corruptions, or discard the draft (if the corruption is only in the draft).    I have created an issue to track a fix on the already corrupted links: CONFSERVER-55249  {panel}  h3. Steps to Reproduce    # Set up an instance with no context path, eg [http://localhost:8090/]   # Create a page and add some images, attachments and user mentions to it   -- Confirm it displays ok   # Shut down Confluence and set a context path, eg [http://localhost:8090/confluence]   # Restart and update the base URL in <USER>> General Configurations   # view the page   -- Observe that the images are still ok   # Edit the page   -- Observe that the images are broken in edit mode   # Type some text and save   -- Observe that the images are still broken    This is likely happening because Synchrony saved the links with the old BaseURL, and then when the BaseURL changed, those changes aren't propagated into Synchrony (because it's saving the editor format).  h3. Workaround  h5. Turn Collaborative Editing Off and back On (recommended)    It has been confirmed that *turning Synchrony Off and On* again resolves the related issue with links in --CONFSERVER-52455--. It is unclear if this applies to the image issue as well.    !https://jira.<USER>images/icons/emoticons/warning.png|width=16,height=16!   All existing shared drafts are lost when you switch collaborative editing off, so make sure your users have published any work they want to keep before you make the change.   # Go to  !https://confluence.<USER>doc/files/590259974/590058056/1/1398739558493/Cog.png! > *General Configuration* > *Collaborative editing*   # Click *Change mode*   # Select *Off*   # Click *Change*   # Then turn Synchrony back on   # Then [rebuild the index|https://confluence.<USER>doc/content-index-administration-148844.html#ContentIndexAdministration-Rebuildingthesearchindex] via the UI   # The issue will stop occurring but you will need to go back and manually restore any pages that were affected  ## You can restore the page to an older version  ## Or you can manually adjust the links    h5. Note about this workaround  When Collaborative Editing is enabled, and a page is being edited, all those small changes are stored in Synchrony in-memory cache/events table on the database. That includes the base URL.   When the base URL got changed in Confluence, Synchrony won't be aware of this change. When turning off Collaborative Editing, you discard all the data that Synchrony had and when enabling again, you are forcing to fetch a new copy of the base URL from Confluence. That's how turning it off and on again helps workaround this issue    h5.

If turning off Collaborative Editing is not an option or the affected area is not too big for the instance, there is a workaround that can be applied to a page to fix it on a page to page   basis:  # Edit the affected page that has either _User Mention_ or _Attachment Link_ in it  # Save the page without making any changes (this would break the page due to this bug)  # Revert the page back to the history of 1 version before the current broken version (the version that has all the user mentions and attachment links still intact)    Now that the page has been _affected_ once, any edits after this will not cause the user mentions or attachment links to change again.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Embedded JIRA macro in Page Properties Grandchild Page causes Continuous Loop of Page","h4. Summary    Per Developer Escalation creating this defect for a problem that occurs when a Page Properties report on a grandchild Page contains an embedded JIRA macro. The ultimate parent page will be thrown into a continuously refreshing loop, and we are unable to stop the loop from occurring without forcing the browser to stop.  h4. Steps to Reproduce   # Create a new Confluence 6.0.6 instance   # Add the demo site content and a <USER>account   # Import the attached Space Export [^se2.zip] into the newly created Confluence 6.0.6 site   # Perform a Content Indexing administration for the site   # Navigate to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing   # Observe the page in a *continuous loop* as the Page Properties report in a grandchild page has a JIRA issues gadget in the report   # Observe that you can not stop the page from looping by clicking links, the back button or other methods   # Quit your browser   # Reopen your browser   # Go to <yourConfluenceURL>/display/TS2/Summary+of+BLUE+Child+Pages   # Remove the JIRA Gadget in the report for *Blue page 1, with JIRA Gadget*   # Navigate back to <yourConfleunceURL>/display/TS2/Page+Properties+testing   # Observe that the page looping is no longer present    h4. Expected Results    Page Properties reports would display without issue and the page would render normally.  h4. Actual Results    Page becomes stuck in a loop, and continues to attempt to render the reports - refreshing the page continuously and appending to the page URL with each attempt. The only way to stop the rendering is to force the browser to stop the attempt by manual intervention.   h4. Workaround    The only workaround at present is to insure that JIRA macros are only embedded at the Child Page level and *no* *deeper* than the child level, or the looping will occur. ",Bug,Low,Closed,"2017-03-24 12:01:24","2017-03-24 12:01:24",5

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Indexer does not handle attachments efficiently for a page update","h3. Summary  There are two *different* symptoms for this problem, but both go back to the same root cause.    h5. Scenario 1  When a page is updated and needs to be indexed, the indexer does not add the attachments, comments and permissions into the journal table. This will overload the hibernate session, where it will pick up items from the journal table. These items will introduce more work on the indexer than expected, where it will need to process all the attachments, comments and permissions of the current page. From the user perspective, it will look like the indexer stalls and slow at processing a small number of tasks     h5. Scenario 2  When a page is updated multiple times and those changes are included in a single indexer batch, the indexer does not handle this efficiently. It will index those changes with every change.      h3. Steps to Reproduce  Reproducing this behavior for Scenario 2 will require multiple quick updates to a certain page (within 5 seconds.)    *Hint:* This can be done through rest api   # Create a new page   # Add multiple attachments to the page (preferably large attachments)   # Edit the page and save   # Edit the page again and save   # Edit the page a third time and save   # Enable DEBUG logging for the package        h3. Expected Results  The indexer will show that it is processing the page along with all the attachments, comments and permission efficiently.   The page should be processed *only once* in a single batch.        h3. Actual Results  The indexer will show that it is processing a single page only while it is actually processing page, attachments, comment and permissions. Also the indexer will process each change separately, redoing all the work again.  This is very time and resource consuming and will cause the indexer to stall or lead to an outage      Large attachments can affect the processing time as well. Below is the log snippet of the behavior for *Scenario 1*  {code:borderStyle=solid}  2017-03-21 11:15:03,887 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 291 items in 43881 milliseconds  2017-03-21 11:14:20,006 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  2017-03-21 11:14:16,240 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 2338 items in 276234 milliseconds  2017-03-21 11:09:40,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  2017-03-21 11:09:36,402 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-2] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 1527 items in 466396 milliseconds  2017-03-21 11:01:50,006 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-2] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  2017-03-21 11:01:47,935 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 1778 items in 667844 milliseconds  2017-03-21 10:50:40,091 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-1] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  2017-03-21 10:50:36,342 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-6] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 869 items in 26337 milliseconds  2017-03-21 10:50:10,004 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-6] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  ....  2017-03-21 10:48:02,290 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 6 items in 2285 milliseconds  2017-03-21 10:48:00,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  ....  2017-03-21 10:36:50,333 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 4 items in 10325 milliseconds  2017-03-21 10:36:40,007 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-4] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  ....  2017-03-21 10:34:58,947 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-9] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue Flushed 157 items in 3942 milliseconds  2017-03-21 10:34:55,005 DEBUG [scheduler_Worker-9] [confluence.search.lucene.DefaultConfluenceIndexManager] flushQueue flush requested  {code}      h3.

Expected Results    Confluence started    h3. Actual Results    Confluence cannot start, no logs are created in catalina.out or Confluence home.   The console showing the issue      h3.

There's a bug in the shell script. If there's a /usr/bin/java file, then JRE_HOME will be temporarily set to /usr and then it will be corrected at the end of the script. So this issue happens on a Linux machine that doesn't have the default JVM installed.  h3. Workaround(s)  * Set {{JAVA_HOME=/opt/atlassian/confluence/jre/}} explicitly before starting Confluence (keep in mind that /opt/atlassian/confluence/jre is the path to Confluence installation direcotry and should be adapted if you are using your own path)  * [Use Confluence with external Oracle JDK (recommended)|https://confluence.<USER>doc/installing-java-for-confluence-144212101.html]  * Remove the {{exit 1}} lines  * Move {{JRE_HOME=/opt/atlassian/confluence/jre/; export JRE_HOME}} to the top of {{setjre.sh}}  * ",Bug,High,Closed,"2017-03-21 12:51:50","2017-03-21 12:51:50",3

Through SQL logging in JIRA, we find that the following components appear to impact the query return time greatly:  * For every project, JIRA appears to fire off one SQL query for each role that exists. In other words, the cost is _number of roles_ times _number of projects_.  * JIRA fires off one SQL query for each shared filter (i.e. excluding private filters).

Transcription from HC:    {quote}  [11:33 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: so it's asking for the same icon ~30 times?  [11:34 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: is it possible to cache that somehow, at least for the same call? (which is what we're seeing here)  [11:41 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: I'm still trying to see where the rest resource inlines any attachments, rather than just generating links to them  [11:41 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: (because browsers are great at ensuring they only retrieve a link once)  [11:41 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: yeah :D  [11:41 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: although for that to work, you probably need a signed url  [11:41 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: but in any case, that'd be better, yes  [11:42 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.rest.resources.EventResource#getEvents(java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String, java.lang.String) is the entry point for that rest request  [11:42 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: or using something like VCache or whatever to cache the icons for a while, if the probability of them being repeated is high  [11:42 AM] Eduardo Garcia [Atlassian]: we can also do some kind of caching in our side at some point, but it's a lot more involved of course :)  [11:48 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: I'm not seeing anything that would cause a rest request to have an inlined attachment of any kind. Have you been able to reproduce this on any test env?  [11:49 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: What I am seeing is that reminder notifications (and other notification types) will inline images, but that's only when generating emails  [11:50 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: What sort of zipkin trace header integration was created for the jobs triggered by the external job scheduler?  [11:50 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: are they triggered through rest requests, or through SQS?  [11:51 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: Because it all feels like we're looking in the wrong place  [11:54 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: hmmmmm, maybe not  [11:54 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: any time DefaultResourceDataHandler.createAttachmentDataHandler is called, it reads all the bytes in the relevant attachment  [11:55 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: and that *could* be being called on rest requests, even when that DataHandler is subsequently not used for anything  [11:56 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: that's all as a side effect of invoking com.atlassian.confluence.extra.calendar3.calendarstore.event.transformers.SubCalendarEventSupportingInviteesTransformer#transform  [11:59 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: It looks like that Transformer will only trigger the problem if there is precisely one invitee for the event that's being sent. If there are more, then we'll just append the names of the invitees (sounds like bad ux)  [11:59 AM] <USER>[Atlassian]: Looks like you're getting 30 requests for the same file because you're retrieving 30 events with the same user  [12:00 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: You'll be happy to know that switching to Aa managed avatars will probably make this problem go away for you  [12:02 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: of course, it will also *break* in that case, because it assumes that all profile pictures are still managed by Confluence's AttachmentManager  [12:11 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: @DuyLuong which issue tracker should @Edu  raise a bug in?  [12:12 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: Looks like we can fix an ugly performance and memory problem at the same time, simply by making the Transformer (or DataHandler) aware that it's rendering for REST vs a notification  [12:13 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: (notification ==> inline any Avatar that isn't external)  [12:13 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: And at the same time, we can fix the bug where external avatars will cause NPEs or worse  [12:14 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: Just because a ProfilePictureInfo has a downloadPath, it doesn't mean that path is inside Confluence  [12:15 PM] <USER>[Atlassian]: I'm assuming that there's another team taking care of the Cloud side of the TeamCal fork...  {quote}    ",Bug,Low,Closed,"2017-02-24 02:10:33","2017-02-24 02:10:33",3

That should only happen the first time the job runs. Every other time it will be populated with Synchrony's actual status.    We should fix the VCache issue with Hazelcast. We shouldn't use a supplier in the get for the cache miss, because it will make all page loads slow since it is used by the SynchronyDownBannerDataProvider which determines if the banner should be displayed or not.

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Confusing Restrict Page UI leads users to think their Edit button is wrongly missing","h2. Problem summary  The Restrict Page dialog can be mislead an administrator into thinking he/she has view/edit privileges when the admin is in fact restricted from doing so. This leads to confusion such as thinking that the Edit button is erroneously missing from a page.    h2. Scenario  Imagine a scenario where an admin has permissions to modify page restrictions, and goes to view a page which contains a page restriction. The admin is not currently page of list of privileged users that are allowed to edit the page, and notices that the Edit button is (correctly) missing. The admin then clicks the Padlock on a given page, and confusingly sees that his/her username is *already listed* among the other privileged users.    The admin thus believes a bug has been encountered (since the Edit button is missing) when really it's an issue with the Restrict Page dialog design. Consider the following two examples:    h2. Example 1 - When there are no page restrictions initially  * Create a page without any restrictions  * Log in as a user who can modify restrictions, and click the Padlock icon  * Change the dropdown to Viewing and Editing restricted. Observe that your username is automatically shown in the dialog below    In this example, it is easy for the user to understand that while the username is shown with Can view and edit, the changes are not committed until the Apply button is pressed. In other words, the dialog is showing you *what the restrictions config will update to if the Apply button is pressed*, rather than what is currently set for the page (which is nothing).    |Unrestricted page|What admin sees when clicking padlock and selecting  Viewing and Editing restricted in the dropdown|  |!unrestrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!norestrictions.png|thumbnail!|    h2. Example 2 - When there are already restrictions on the page  * Create a page and restrict editing to yourself (but allow everyone to view)  * Log in as a different user who can modify restrictions, navigate to the page and hit the Padlock button    In this example, there are already existing restrictions on the page. The Restrictions dialog shows everyone that is part of the existing restrictions, however (just like in Example 1) it _also_ shows the current who is not currently part of it. The dialog is once again showing what the restrictions config for the page will look like *if the Apply button is pressed.*    |Page with existing restrictions|What admin sees when clicking padlock|  |!restrictedpage.png|thumbnail!|!existingrestrictions.png|thumbnail!|    This is a display problem is because the user, at this moment, is not actually part of the restrictions configs, and cannot edit the page. If the user presses Apply, that *will* in fact update the restrictions configs such that the user can edit the page afterwards. *The confusing part here is that there's nothing in the UI which clearly indicates what are the current settings, and what are the new changes that will occur if the button is pressed.*    In the case of Example 2, we can avoid this confusion by simply not auto-listing the current user viewing the Restrictions dialog, except when the user is factually part of the page restriction configs.",Bug,Medium,"Gathering Impact","2016-12-24 06:21:20","2016-12-24 06:21:20",5

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Confluence incorrectly using HTTP protocol to reach synchrony-proxy during healthcheck when running over SSL","h2. Problem summary    When Confluence's server.xml is configured to run over SSL, the healthcheck URL continues to use the HTTP protocol to reach synchrony-proxy, which causes a failure as the request should be over HTTPS.  h2. Steps to reproduce    Install Confluence 6.0.2 to run over SSL (e.g. port 8443) at the Tomcat level (no external proxy involved). Self-signed <USER>is ok as long as it is imported into the Java trust store that Confluence is using.    After startup, observe the following repeated in logs:    Healthcheck URL should be [https://localhost:8443/synchrony-proxy/healthcheck] (HTTPS) rather than plain HTTP.  h2. Workaround   1. Enable the standard HTTP connector port in the {{server.xml}} file, for example:       2. Disable the healthcheck request by setting a system property *synchrony.proxy.healthcheck.disabled* to true (in setenv.sh or setenv.bat) in Confluence 6.1.0 (when it's released).

"Atlassian Confluence Server","External gadgets in Confluence should not prompt users to Login and Approve","Problem:    When using an external gadget (e.g., JIRA gadget Pie Chart) in a Confluence page, every user who views the page is prompted to Login and approve the gadget in JIRA before they can see the content.    This happens *for every user for every gadget,* meaning that if I create a Confluence page using Pie Chart, Filter Results, Average Age Chart, and Two-Dimensional Issue Statistics and send it to executives for review, every executive has to Login and Approve every gadget.

Summary  There is an excessive delay in loading the editor for a Confluence page that has several Jira Issue Macros (JIM) that are using the 'Total Issue Count' option in the 'Display Options'.

Steps to Reproduce  # Install Jira 8.5.8 and Confluence 7.4.3 in test environment. I used PSQL db for the test.  # Populate the application data in JIRA to have 500k to 1 million issues. Confluence can be at default settings.  # Setup an application link between the two servers.  # In Confluence, create a new test page with 15 JIM macros each using JQL to filter the table and make sure that in the 'Display Options' in the macro, the 'Total Issue Count' option is selected. The filter should have a high amount of issues included (500k to 1 million) among several of the macros.  Save the page.  # Notice it reaches out to JIRA to pull total issues for each macro.  # While on the test page, click the EDIT button (top right).    h3. Expected Results  The editor should load in a reasonably quick time, or at least inline with how long it takes to query and retrieve the total issue values from Jira.    h3. Actual Results  The editor takes 3x-5x the time it should to fully load before being available to edit the page.    h3. Notes  - The delay comes from the editor reaching out to JIRA and requesting/loading the total issue counts _after_ the EDIT button has been pressed. This is to include the total issue count for the macros in the editor.  - While viewing a page, there are asynchronous REST calls to get the total issue count for the macros (this is behaving normally) which is several times faster than in edit mode.  - Customers have observed that the delay in v6.15.9 is 50% less than in v7.4.3. for the editor with the same dataset in Jira.    h3.Workaround  There is no workaround at the moment.",Bug,Medium,Closed,"2016-09-26 03:06:23","2016-09-26 03:06:23",3

Now in cwd_user, there is no index on column lower_user_name. The only index there is on lower_user_name is composed with the other column directory_id.

As we dug deeper into the IE11 memory leak issue, we have been able to reliably reproduce the leak within IE11 11.0.9600.18861 (circa 08/2017) on Windows 8. Using a vanilla Confluence installation and refreshing the page a number of time, it can be observed that the memory consumed by the page itself remains consistent, however the iexplore.exe process continues to grow.    Restesting on IE11 11.251.16299.0 (circa 02/2018) and Edge 41.16299.248.0 on Windows 10 we were unable to reproduce the same memory leak.    We have not been able to find a definitive list of the issues fixed in this IE11 release, but believe the issue is [Memory leak - IE Edge - Microsoft Edge 8020622|https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8020622/] (previosuly fixed in Edge only). Therefore, whilst we are confident that this issue can be resolved, there is a small chance that there still remains an issue.    *Resolution:* Please upgrade to Windows 8/10 and the latest version of IE11 (11.251.16299.0) circa 02/2018 and Edge 41.16299.248.0 or greater to fix this issue.

This is certainly an issue which has done its round on the internet over the years for many browser and application vendors alike, with each pointing the finger at each other as to whether the application or browser should observe the EXIF rotation metadata.    The obvious solution is for all browsers to support the 'image-orientation' CSS, however after many years this is still only supported by Firefox.  We have explored no less than 6 different solutions to this issue as each brings pros and cons in terms of performance, behaviour and complexity.  As a result of this exercise, it has been decided that image rotation would be done server side based on the EXIF rotation metadata.    The actual implementation is somewhat different for Server and Cloud deployments, and thus the rollout/delivery may occur at different times, however is high up in the queue right now.

RESULTS  After save, the checkmark does not show up. See attached screenshot 2.  WORKAROUND  1. Insert a space after the emoticon (before the hyperlink) and then click save. Then the emoticon stays.   2. Edit the page again and delete the space you added in step 1. Then save. Then the emoticon stays again whereas before it vanished.    Additional testing has show that emoticons can not be part of the title of a link. When inserting one directly next to a link in edit mode, the emoticon gets rendered (ie  for check <USER>.  Upon saving the page, the emoticon will disappear.   When clicking on the link in edit mode, navigate to the edit option of the link and adding the ( / ) to the title there, the short cut for the emoticon will not get rendered after page save, and the title of the link will simply display the 3 characters ( / )    In effect this appears to relate to CONF-26042    Besides that, another additional testing on Confluence 5.4.4 shows that this issue cannot be replicated if the link inserted to the page is a web link.",Bug,Low,Closed,"2013-11-20 11:38:18","2013-11-20 11:38:18",3

Using *Confluence Cloud*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.<USER>browse/CONFCLOUD-30116].   {panel}  In earlier versions, the JIRA issue macro had a pagination feature. This feature was removed due to observed low feature usage, in addition with our strategic focus to simplify the Confluence user interface and to keep and complex JIRA operations in JIRA. My apologies for the may customers that were quickly impacted by this, we could have done a better job in communicating this and ensuring we had understood your needs with regards to this matter.     Since then we've received a lot of feedback to bring back pagination. Thank you for those of you who provided helpful comments below, and for those customers we have been able to speak to about this. With this in mind, we have concluded the following:    * It is very clear that the current issue limit we have is insufficient and does not meet most of your needs.   * It is important for you to be able to see _all_ the issues requested   * We still believe that the use case of navigating 100+ issues within inside Confluence is something that is extremely low and is something which should be done in JIRA.   * Some of you mentioned of the importance of seeing this also in PDF exports when you share the release notes or pages with customers.     With that in mind, what will we be doing to address this?  1. We will look at increasing the limit of the total number of visible issues  2. In addition, we will look at providing a parameter to configure this.  *Note:* You will always be limited by the total amount of issues JIRA provides, but [this setting can be changed|https://confluence.<USER>display/ONDEMANDKB/Changing+maxResults+Parameter+for+JIRA+REST+API].  3. We will be looking at also implementing CONF-30114 (sorting) to assist with dealing with larger issue lists in Confluence.     Thank you all for your patience in this matter, we will update this issue as we make progress.     <USER> Confluence Product Manager    Previous description:   {panel}  The new JIRA issues macro does not paginate. This feature request is to help us better understand why customers want this.   If you are going to comment on this ticket, please provide some understanding for why you want pagination. We removed this feature because we saw very low usage of it. Since then, we've had a few requests to bring it back.     One way we could solve the majority use case is to increase the default amount of search results displayed. We are a bit hesitant to bring this back as we want to understand what it is that we are missing. If you are embedding 50/100+ issues on a page and want pagination, you probably shouldn't be doing that in Confluence, but rather the JIRA issue navigator - that is why we tell you there are xxx more issues, open in JIRA.     Please help us understand why you want this and some examples where you really do have lots of issues on a page that you want your end-users to read (if that is the use case)  {panel} ",Suggestion,,Closed,"2013-07-26 06:29:56","2013-07-26 06:29:56",0

"Atlassian Confluence Server","Quick Comment Loader Freezes Safari","Updated Summary:    Plugins that use conditions for Atlassian editor resources may cause the browser to freeze in certain environments. This happens with <USER>< 6.0 due to the condition that controls which <USER>Editor is launched (flash vs html5). If you use <USER> updating to 6.x+ should resolve your issue. However, Atlassian should still fix this issue, as this prevents plugins from being able to use conditions for Editor resources.    As <USER>noted, this may also happen with other plugins that also use editor conditions like the 'create-content' plugin in Confluence 5.0    https://developer.<USER>display/DOCS/Web+Item+Plugin+Module#WebItemPluginModule-ConditionandConditionsElements    Original:  I believe this was filed as https://jira.<USER>browse/CONF-25054 and was supposed to be resolved in CONFDEV-8038    On certain customer instances when loading a Confluence page with <USER>enabled, the browser will freeze for a few seconds so you cannot scroll or click on elements. After profiling, it appears that the culprit is atlassians quick comment loader. It basically loads more scripts for the comment editor by creating dynamic script tags and appending it to the document head. Theoretically this should be non-blocking (using dynamic script tags to perform gets should not block rendering) but it appears that in webkit there may be an obscure bug, or it may be delaying the onload event. This behavior is not present in FF and IE even though the batch js request is just as slow.    If you inspect the network tab on the affected sites, the page will hang when it attempts to load particular batch.js files that the comment loader requests. Each one takes around 2+ seconds to receive which is why the page is paused for so long. And indeed if you open up the js console, you'll see: EditorLoader: 2 scripts to be loaded. before the page hangs for a few seconds as the js is loaded.    One of our customers reports that they see this issue when they have enabled the <USER>plugin.    Why is <USER>interacting with this?    If you inspect the code present in AJS.Confluence.EditorLoader.load the loader has two code paths: one is if there is a single file and the other is when there are multiple. The loader uses the a straightforward jQuery.ajax call for a single file, and the dynamic script tag approach when there are multiple.        It may be that our plugin is bumping the number of files to be loaded, so it uses the dynamic tag approach. If it isn't it, it may be that this issue is more noticeable when the batch files are larger.  ",Bug,Medium,Closed,"2013-01-16 00:45:19","2013-01-16 00:45:19",2

Summary    * Copy and pasting lists / sections with only partial selections does not behave in a reasonable manner.    To fix:    * Confirm desired behaviour is what we want  * Need to make sure we have good automated test cases for these selection and copy-paste scenarios  * Fix the underlying issues    [Copy and paste of original comments|http://confluence.<USER>pages/viewpage.action?pageId=278070932]    h3. History from CAC    *Shannon GreyWalker*    EPIC BUG    The conversation thread that culminated in this specific comment up above has shed light on what I think is a super pattern that collectively describes various specific bugs that users have been reporting with the cut/copy/paste/dragMove behavior of the 4.x editor. The most concise way to describe this epic bug is as follows:    *4.x editor does not consistently preserve and reproduce the semantic/visual structure (order and nesting) of a diverse set of selected elements when cutting/copying > pasting, or when drag-moving, into a new location*    Note that I'm stressing the semantic and visual structure of the selection, because the new editor makes it truly impossible to understand how the start and end points of the selection correspond to the specific start and end tags of the underlying selection in the XML storage format of the page. Therefore, all your users can rely on is what they see in the rendered/styled text within the editor. And what they see is always clearly representative of a semantic structure that has a specific order and nesting of semantic elements.    I would very much like to see a single JIRA issue number assigned to this overarching epic bug so that I can track a single JIRA ticket instead of multiple more granular JIRA tickets. Why? Because IMO this is one more showstopper issue that will prevent my company from migrating from 3.5.x to 4.x. Now that I've been banging specifically on copy/cut/paste/dragMove mechanics and seeing how truly dysfunctional the overall behavior currently is even in 4.1.5, I cannot give a green light internally to migration until the meta-issue I describe above is fully resolved in the most typical use cases. Now that I understand that these problems are essentially all bugs and not behavior as designed, which can be managed correctly through some common conceptual workarounds, I cannot force this confusing behavior on my user base.    It's worth noting that in the old wiki syntax, what you select is always 100% obvious, and is exactly what you paste, and the resulting behavior is always 100% predictable. So this is an entirely new problem introduced with the 4.x environment. Remember, moving things around in and between pages is at least 50% or more of what your heads-down users spend their time doing in the editor. Writing is mostly revision.    I strongly recommend that once you get this epic bug resolved, you create several functional tests based on several test pages that you always faithfully run during regression for every single point release of Confluence, and you do not release if any of those functional tests fail. Why, again because cut/copy/paste/dragMove is at least 50% of what your users spend every hour in Confluence actually doing. Your code for cut/copy/paste/dragMove needs to be 100% reliable and predictable based upon what your users can actually see and infer in the rendered WYSIsortaWYG text in the editor. It was 100% reliable before in wiki syntax mode, so it needs to be the same in 4.x or we have a net loss and lots of confused and pissed-off users.    Here are two specific and common functional tests I can think of off the top of my head. Both of these also serve to illustrate the meta pattern I describe above for this epic bug:    h5.Functional Test 1 - Cut and paste within an ordered list     h6. Test object         h6. Sub Test 1.1 - Select from start of semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent       # Select from the first character of the text within parent Step 3 through:  ## The last character of the text within child Step 3.b.  ## The last character of the text within child Step 3.b, and then press Shift + rightArrow one time to extend the selection highlight to the right margin of the editor frame.  ## Also select the entire scope of Step 3 > 3.a > 3.b by placing the selection point immediately before the first character of the text within parent Step 3, then using Shift + downArrow three times to extend the selection highlight to the right margin of the editor frame for Step 3.b.  ## The middle of the text within child Step 3.b (end just before the word originally).  # Cut the selection.  # Place the selection point immediately before the first character of the text within Step 2.  # Paste the cut selection.

Sub Tests    Okay I'm not going to make another long vertical wall of specific tests and expected results here, because hopefully you see how the same testing pattern enumerated for the ordered list test object would be applied to this new test object comprising a semantic mixed content model for common combinations of paragraph and list block elements plus some nested macro objects (each of which contains a mixture of typical paragraph and list block elements.    The basic idea is to apply the same four tests here to this new test object, ideally within *Section 2* because it contains the most complex mixture of semantic objects.    * Sub Test 2.1 - Select from start of one semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent. For example, what would you intuitively expect to happen if you selected the entire panel macro in *Section 2* and then pasted the selection with your insertion point immediately before the first character of the first bullet in the bullet list of *Section 1*. Yeah, you see where I'm going here, right? Do you get this intuitively expected result right now? Nope.  * Sub Test 2.2 - Select from start of one semantic parent, paste in middle of another semantic parent. I won't bore you with examples. I hope you get it by now.  * Sub Test 2.3 - Select from middle of one semantic parent, paste before start of another semantic parent. Yada yada.  * Sub Test 2.4 - Select from middle of one semantic parent, paste in middle of another semantic parent. Yada yada.    *The bottom line with all these functional test objects and the four typical semantic cut/copy/paste/dragMove sub tests to perform on each one boils down to one intuitively expected UX pattern:*    * Structurally speaking, the clipped/pasted result of a selection should be the exact same whether the selection's end-point is at the end of a visible text line in the editor or the end-point is at the right margin. Yes, under the covers this subtle distinction makes for a different range in the tinyMCE's information it gets from the browser, but for a user looking at the screen, there is no distinction; it's the same exact thing. Your code should reflect this user perception and should not reflect the actual technical distinction under the covers in the DOM.    * The complete visual and semantic structure of the clipped selection should be preserved and reproduced exactly the same in the new, pasted context, AND    * The visual and semantic structure into which you pasted the clipped selection should split around the inserted paste and that split structure should be maintained with the same exact structure in both halves of the split.    * When you have to make a decision between acting upon what's really selected (or where the insertion point is) based on the underlying DOM of the selection range reported by the browser versus what the user sees visually in the editor and thinks of as being the semantic objects I've selected, you should always decide in favor of what the user visually and conceptually sees with their own eyes.    * Good luck with this. I'm sure it can be done. The question is: how soon? And what JIRA issue number do I track to watch for completion of this?    ----    *<USER>    Hi Shannon. I apologise for the delay in responding to this comment. I've been in contact with our bug-fixing team to go through the issues you have described here. We will get one or more issues raised soon, as appropriate and let you know the numbers for tracking purposes.
