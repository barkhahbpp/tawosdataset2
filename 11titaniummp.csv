V3 support is in our mid-term roadmap  (~ 6 months)  2) Can we use XIB files and storyboards in Hyperloop?  If not, is it on the roadmap.    3) Similar to above - can we support storyboards in Hyperloop?  #2 & #3: XIB files and Storyboards are supported. They just need to be programmatically loaded. There is an example for XIB files at https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop-examples/blob/master/app/controllers/ios/xib.js and to use a storyboard they can to load it with https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uistoryboard  4) Can Hyperloop call a overloaded function of a class?  I believe the answer is no and that it is a limitation of Hyperloop.  If so, will this limitation ever be mitigated?  If so, where on the roadmap is this.  Hyperloop does support method overloading. On Android, Hyperloop will figure out the matching overloaded method of a class by inspecting the types of the given parameters. iOS has named parameters which results in different method names anyway, so that's a non-issue there.  5)  Q and A archives were removed from the website after the merger.  Can we get them back?  This was done before the Axway acquisition, over 2 years ago when was decided to move to StackOverflow,  an archive was keep for some time but most of the information was outdate.    The open source community created this Q&A using our old archives,  most of the info is out of date by now https://ti-qa-archive.github.io/  6) We need a real answer on debugging.  It hasn't really worked well since Alloy was introduced.  To me, the obvious reason is that we create  classic (non Alloy) code before running / debugging on a simulator or device.  The ties back to the XML / JS / TSS  are not intact during debugging.  I just tried to debug our Hyperloop Examples app by putting a breakpoint in the main listview's click event.  This breakpoint never got hit.    The debugging capabilities for Hyperloop in Studio are indeed not optimal right now. This is because Hyperloop modifies the source files which throws the debugger off its tracks. We have tickets like TIMOB-24037 that will be scheduled in the next couple of months  Nonetheless on iOS it is possible to debug apps using the Safari Web Inspector which allows debugging Hyperloop because it is directly talking to the active JS context inside the running app. Shockoe has posted a short tutorial how to do that here. This approach allows debugging all Hyperloop code up to where it switches over to the native side. The only downside to this is that there are no source maps available for processed Alloy controllers. We have also worked on the Android equivalent of this which allows using Chrome Dev tools in TIMOB-24723 and is currently under review.",Improvement,Medium,Closed,"2017-10-09 23:50:51","2017-10-09 23:50:51",1

We can call it Appcelerator Private or Arrow, but the MBaaS and Enterprise MBaaS are references to ArrowDB which is just one component of the solution. Note that we will change the names once we agree upon new naming-  * -Page 12: Requirements. One of the first things on this page needs to be # of physical or virtual machines needed. For example, how many nodes are recommended in development/non-prod environments vs prod? Also which nodes should one place which services on?-  * -Page 13: SHouldn’t we reference the need for internet connectivity? Or in the case of absence thereof, the need for an internal npm registry mirror?-  * -Page 13: Has some TBD sections that don’t look good. We should fill them out or take them out.-  * Page 16,17,18 etc - -We reference ArrowCloud / ArrowDB all-in-one and App container base nodes. Can we include information someplace about what services are run on each of these nodes? This overview and terminology may be a good way to kick off the Pre-install section for the benefit of someone looking at this for the first time.-  * Pages 19, 20 -etc show pictures of ArrowCloud and ArrowDB architecture of processes for the first time.- We are breaking away from talking nodes/VMs on previous pages to talking processes for the first time, and it is not evident how these processes are spread out across nodes. Any information we can share here will help with adoption.  * -Page 21 talks about Developer Cloud on boarding - is there a reason we’re calling it that vs Developer on boarding?-  * -Page 21 references Appcelerator Studio. We support the use of Appcelerator Studio and the CLI both equally, in fact we’re steering away Arrow Development from Appcelerator Studio to a BYO-editor model. We should reference the CLI scenario here, and in fact take out references to Appc Studio.-  * -Page 47 talks about the SSL_PEM file. Note that PEM or Analytics is an optionally buyable separate product from Appcelerator Private / Appcelerator Arrow. In our documentation, we should first reference why you would want to use SSL_PEM (if you want to emit Analytics events to an external dashboard). Note also that starting with 1.5.4, you always use an on-premises dashboard when using Arrow Cloud behind the firewall. We no longer recommend the use of Arrow Cloud on-premises mixed in with a Cloud dashboard.-  * -Page 51 talks about deploying Arrow Cloud to VPC. This does not belong in Appcelerator Private or Appcelerator Arrow documentation.-  * -Page 56 talks about installing the Registry and Security server. We should first talk about installing the “dashboard”, which I don’t see referenced anywhere in the documentation.-  * -Page 61 talks about installing Registry server with Docker. Isn’t this a 1.6.0 thing?-  * -Page 65 talks about Developer Cloud Onboarding. See reference to Developer Cloud above.-",Improvement,High,Closed,"2017-02-07 17:50:52","2017-02-07 17:50:52",24

This Jenkins job can be a part of the entire scripting process or set up a watcher Jenkins job that monitors the repo for any updates (like file count changes, date stamp differences, etc).  # Document everything (scripts, process, etc.)    Note: the final process won't likely include Github.     Once there is a working version of all this, share the scripts, Github location, and documentation with Danail (Danny) Grigorov, Gabriel Stroe, and Marin Vasilev.    Finally, this process will likely be used to push all other Appcelerator doc sets to the Axway portal in the near future (in particular all the Arrow products).

"Titanium Mobile Platform","Document debugging iOS apps with 3rd-party tools","# Debugging iOS Apps with 3rd-party tools  No matter the route you take, you'll need to be sure you're using the included jscore framework option first.    ## Turn on use-jscore-framework  The key is to turn on the use-jscore-framework option in your tiapp.xml.  ```xml  <tiapp>  ...    <ios>  ...      <use-jscore-framework>true</use-jscore-framework>  ...    </ios>  ...  </tiapp>  ```    Once enabled, this will force Titanium to use the pre-packaged JSCore framework/engine as the Javascript engine internally (rather than our older TiCore framework, which is a mdofiied version of JSCore).    Since iOS 7, the pre-packaged JScore framework has contained a debugging agent and protocol using webinspectord. We make use of this service/protocol with our newest iOS debugger in Titanium 6, as does Safari in it's tooling.    ## Debugging with Safari DevTools  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    ### Launch the app on device or simulator    Simply launch your application via Studio, or the command line:  ```bash  appc run -p ios  ```    /!\ Be sure to connect your device by the USB cord first, if debugging on device.    ### Enabled Develop menu in Safari  Now open Safari and ensure you have the **Develop** menu enabled to appear. You can enable it from Safari's Preferences > Advanced.    ![Show Develop menu in menu bar](enabled_develop_safari.png Show Develop menu in menu bar)    ### Connect to the app  Once the app is up and running, you can connect the debugger by:  - Simulator: **Safari > Developer > Simulator > JSContext**  - Device: **Safari > Developer > Device Name > JSContext**    #### Breakpoints early in app lifecycle not getting hit?    Sometimes you cannot connect the debugger to the app until it's already executed the code you'd like to break at. One way to workaround this is to launch the simulator first, then open **Safari > Develop > Simulator** and ensure **Automatically Show Web Inspector for JSContexts** and **Automatically Pause Connecting to JSContexts** are both turned on/checked. Then launch the app/build via Studio/CLI and you should be able to connect and control the debugger before the app fully launches.      ## Using Google Chrome and ios-webkit-debug-proxy  Be sure to turn on use-jscore-framework as shown above first.    Google has created a proxy middleman utility to be able to use Google's Chrome tooling with iOS simulators/webkit, and it is available at [ios-webkit-debug-proxy](https://github.com/google/ios-webkit-debug-proxy)    From my own experience, I haven't been able to reliably use this to hit breakpoints and inspect the state of the app. However, I have found the Console tab to work for evaluating arbitrary code in the context of the app.    If you'd like to try it out:  - Launch the Simulator  - Launch the app  - Open Terminal and start ios-webkit-debug-proxy  - Open Google Chrome to http://localhost:9221/  - Click on the [link for the simulator](http://localhost:9222/)  - Click on the [? link](http://localhost:9222/devtools/devtools.html?ws=localhost:9222/devtools/page/1) for the inspectable page","New Feature",Medium,Closed,"2016-09-27 20:56:38","2016-09-27 20:56:38",3

It keeps telling me my username/passoword are invalid, but I know they are not. I can login just fine using the same credentials on appcelerator.com.     *Cause:*    If the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to development, the appc-platform-sdk module essentially assumes you are an internal developer for appcelerator and forces you to a pre-production or development environment if you have it configured.     I don't have development info configured so it was sending me to pre-prod.     I'm guessing pre-prod only has certain accounts whitelisted for login and just returns 4xx invalid login for everyone else which is why I was getting that error.    *Recommended Fixes*    1. *Use another (e.g. namespaced) environment variable*. This is only useful for your engineers internally so just namespace it to like APPC_NODE_ENV. NODE_ENV can be used by other developers and other projects for many uses (for better or for worse).    2. If you're in development mode, print this out at the top of appc commands that hit the API. If you're going to silently change how your entire module behaves for the end user, based on this common env variable, you should at least read that you're in development/preproduction mode and print this out to the user.    3.

The first will try to find a region specific language and otherwise try the general.  * Point out that you can use {{Ti.Locale.currentLocale}} to set to the user's locale, but this will only work if you have use either of the above methods to make sure Alloy has included those locales on compile.",Improvement,Low,Closed,"2015-12-17 20:16:50","2015-12-17 20:16:50",1

Currently, only iOS is supported. There are tickets (TIMOB-19485, TIMOB-19486, TIMOB-19487) to add support for DefaultIcon.png to the other platforms.    The DefaultIcon.png must be square.

The DefaultIcon.png only comes into play if an app icon or iTunesArtwork is missing. Missing app icons will break the build. Missing iTunesArtwork will not.    NOTE: iTunesArtwork is only applicable to dist-adhoc builds. Older Titanium SDKs (4.x and older) copied iTunesArtwork for device and dist-appstore builds, but no more!    New Titanium apps will come with a DefaultIcon.png that is 1024x1024.    So, the major breakage is that if your app is missing an appicon, the build errors out. Existing apps won't have the DefaultIcon.png, so they will have to copy the file from a new project or create one (which they should do anyways).

"Titanium Mobile Platform","Mixed use of (Arrow) Cloud terminology is confusing users","Through meetups, Q&A and other interaction with users, I noticed there's confusion about Arrow Cloud. At some places we use it as a 1:1 rebranding of Node.ACS while on others it acts as an umbrella that includes ArrowDB & Push as well.

The current ACS website (cloud.appcelerator.com) will be discontinued in favor of the Platform’s integrated dashboard._  * http://docs.appcelerator.com/arrowdb/latest/#!/guide/quickstart uses the word _Cloud_ a lot, potentially causing confusion by using terms like:  ** _ArrowDB Cloud_ where it could just say _ArrowDB_  ** _Platform or Cloud Services_ where it could just say _Platform Services_  * Appcelerator Studio where (see screenshot) the Appcelerator Platform Services list _Cloud_ while it really is only about ArrowDB, which is also the documentation where the (i) links to.    h3.

"Titanium Mobile Platform","Font size/color adjustments on docs.appcelerator.com","Maybe I'm just getting old, but I find the main font color on docs.appcelerator.com to be lacking sufficient contrast, and a point size too small.    Contrast is key when reading on a digital device (e.g. http://www.engadget.com/2013/09/04/e-ink-new-higher-contrast-carta-display-amazon-kindle-paperwhite/). Low contrast displays makes your eyes work harder to discern characters/words.     The body text on our docs currently use #484848, a nice subtle grey (which may be the JSDuck default color I'm not sure). For comparison, Android developer docs use #222, which is practically black (http://www.color-hex.com/color/222222).     For font size, we use a 13px font size for main body content. Again, maybe just me, but it seems a bit small and I always bump it up in the browser. For comparison, Android dev docs use a 14px body font size, and 13px for code fonts.     I've attached screenshots of an API page with the current and suggested font color/size changes:    - Color: #222 or 'black'  - 14px main font  - 13px code listing font     In the proposed screenshot, I also changed the font on the hierarchy (e.g, Titanium Proxy > Titanium Mobile > Titanium Accelerometer) from Courier New to the default sans-serif font...just because I think it looks better.

"Titanium Mobile Platform","Add performance improvement to best practice for node.acs","Currently node.acs servers are located in US Oregon. We need to document the impact of physical distance to server performance to our customers. It is not always possible to have node.acs server running close to the source or majority clients (NODEJS-1732). However, this is a common problem and there are some ways to improve performance but should be considered app by app.    1. Efficiently use cache. Caching data inside node.acs server in memory without having to lookup the source and build on the fly every time could significantly improve overall app performance.   2. Reduce response data size from node.acs to client. Always use compression and send back only essential data set if possible. To improve mobile app performance, it is recommended to have one api call to get minimum set data synchronously to display on the device, another async api call to load additional data.   3. Consider using S3 or cloudfront for large data .  If node.acs aggregates large set of data and the data doesn't change all the time, it would be a good idea to upload them to S3 or cloudfront and have the client download the data from S3 or cloudfront instead. So the client would make an api call to node.acs server to get the url to the s3 or cloudfront data then the client can make another api call to s3 or cloudfront to download the real data. It is never recommended to have node.acs directly transfer large amount of data to the client.   4. use cloudfront to store static contents. it is strongly discouraged to keep static content inside a node.acs app. If developers can move all static contents to cloudfront ahead of time, then they would see big performance in their node.acs app. In principle, node.acs app should be only used to provide dynamic data.     Heroku has a section talking about how to use amazon cloudfront, it is probably a good idea to have a section in our node.acs guide as well.

Although the default setting (in the code) is for all platforms to be checked, the corresponding LocalStorage data from which these settings are read isn't getting updated properly in some cases, -probably because the browser is loading a cached version of the page/script-. because the LocalStorage data that's read to determine what to filter is out of sync with new filtering logic.      The code needs to account for this and show everything if the LocalStorage platform filter settings are undefined.    h4. Work-arounds    * Close all browser windows, clear the browser cache, and re-open the docs site. All the filter items should now be checked.  * Open the 'Filter' menu and check all the platforms. Your settings will be persisted.  ",Bug,Medium,Closed,"2014-09-05 22:02:34","2014-09-05 22:02:34",5
