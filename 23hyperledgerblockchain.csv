The Raft-based ordering service is simpler to operate since it requires no dependencies external to the orderer nodes. It also enables the ordering service to be provided by different organizations across different data centers. For these reasons we expect Raft to become the preferred ordering service choice for production Fabric networks.

[static_analysis]   A static code analysis tool examines the software code (as source code, intermediate code, or executable) without executing it with specific inputs. For purposes of this criterion, compiler warnings and safe language modes do not count as static code analysis tools (these typically avoid deep analysis because speed is vital). Some static analysis tools focus on detecting generic defects, others focus on finding specific kinds of defects (such as vulnerabilities), and some do a combination. Examples of such static code analysis tools include cppcheck (C, C++), clang static analyzer (C, C++), SpotBugs (Java), FindBugs (Java) (including FindSecurityBugs), PMD (Java), Brakeman (Ruby on Rails), lintr (R), goodpractice (R), Coverity Quality Analyzer, SonarQube, Codacy, and HP Enterprise Fortify Static Code Analyzer. Larger lists of tools can be found in places such as the Wikipedia list of tools for static code analysis, OWASP information on static code analysis, NIST list of source code security analyzers, and Wheeler's list of static analysis tools. The SWAMP is a no-cost platform for assessing vulnerabilities in software using a variety of tools.

In some cases the OSS-Fuzz project may be willing to apply fuzz testing to your project. For purposes of this criterion the dynamic analysis tool needs to vary the inputs in some way to look for various kinds of problems or be an automated test suite with at least 80% branch coverage.

Not heavily performance tuned, but performance testing has started with the first few hotspots identified and perhaps even addressed. No “highest priority” issues are in an open state. First-level developer documentation provided to help new developers with the learning curve.    alpha  Feature complete, for all features committed to the production release. Ready for Proof of Concept-level deployments. Performance can be characterized in a predictable way, so that basic PoC's can be done within the bounds of published expectations. APIs are documented. First attempts at end-user documentation have been made. Developer documentation is further advanced. No “highest priority” issues are in an open state.    beta  Feature complete for all features committed to the production release, perhaps with optional features when safe to add. Ready for Pilot-level engagements. Performance is very well characterized and active optimizations are being done, with a target set for the Production release. No “highest priority” or “high priority” bugs are in an open state. Developer documentation is complete; end-user documentation is mostly done.    rcN  For a forthcoming production release, we will prepare multiple candidate releases intended to be heavily tested by the community. As we cycle through resolving uncovered issues, we will issue another when no remaining highest or high priority issues remain, and repeat until we feel confident in releasing a production release, with no qualifier. e.g. 1.0.    1) Note that this is not about exiting from the incubator, though a beta or production release should not be made while still in incubation.  2) Further, for interim, possibly unstable builds working towards a tagged release, we will append the first seven (7) characters of the SHA-1 hash of the latest commit for the branch from which the build is produced, so that we can identify the commit level of a given test, etc. e.g. 0.6-snapshot-36e99cd    ",Task,Medium,Complete,"2019-04-10 20:34:18","2019-04-10 20:34:18",0.5

The following changes will affect both the saving and retrieval of peer information in explorer.  1)  The mapping of peer to channel needs to be saved in peer_ref_channel table, NOT peer table.  2) While reading in info from config.json on peers,  save all the peer information in peer table and mapping of peer to channel in peer_ref_channel table. Do not save channel  name in peer.name, peer.server_name should serve the purpose of peer's name, remove peer.server_name column from peer table and store server name in name column instead.   3) The peer list on dashboard page should show only the peers that belong to the selected channel in dropdown ( default channel name comes from config.json) and hence that info would come from a join of peer and peer_ref_channel tables. When a user chooses a different channel name in dropdown, the peer list on dashboard must refresh.    ",Task,Medium,Complete,"2018-06-19 14:01:11","2018-06-19 14:01:11",5

"Hyperledger Blockchain Explorer","Resolve licensing issues discovered by Fossology scan","h1. Context    Hyperledger Explorer source files (from April 3, 2018) were scanned by The Linux Foundation utilizing Fossology to determine license for files contained in the following repositories:   *  https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/blockchain-explorer    From the Hyperledger Charter (https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter) Section 13, all files that are included in Hyperledger projects should either be licensed with the Apache License, Version 2.0 for source code or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License for documentation.  h1. Expected Behavior    All files should have license text included either directly or via a LICENSE file in the directory for files that cannot be modified to include a comment with the license text (think binary files).  h1. Actual Behavior    See attached results of the scan.  h1. To Fix    The package metadata files (generally bower.json / package.json for NPM) incorrectly describe the Hyperledger Explorer as licensed under ISC, rather than Apache. NPM's default is ISC so this is a common mistake. I've highlighted these instances in the attached reports. These files should be changed from ISC to Apache-2.0.    For files with Attribution license, ideally, we would replace those with Apache 2.0 files and dependencies; otherwise, we will need to go to the Hyperledger Governing board for an exception.    For _ALL_ files that do not have a license included, the first step is to check with the contributor to ensure that the file can be released as Apache 2.0 or CC-BY-4.0. If the contributor agrees, the file should be modified to include the license. You can utilize [SPDX Identifiers |https://spdx.org/]to represent the correct license.    For those non-modifiable files, you will need to include a LICENSE file in the directory containing the license that the files are covered by. Here are a few examples of how this might be done:  * [OPNFV Apex|https://github.com/opnfv/apex/blob/master/LICENSE.rst] -- this is an example of explicitly calling out Apache 2.0 for source code and CC-BY-4.0 for docs.   * [containerd|https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/master/README.md] -- see notice at bottom. This also calls out the separate Apache / CC-BY-4.0 docs, and explicitly references the docs directory.  h1. *Before closing this bug, please let me know that you have made the above changes.
