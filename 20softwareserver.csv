For a cluster of issues, the dot is placed at the average cycle time for the issues.  * The horizontal placement indicates when the issue(s) transitioned out of the last status selected on the chart (in Columns). For example, if you are using the JIRA Software Development workflow and have selected 'In Progress' and 'In Review' as the Columns on the Control Chart, the dots will indicate when the issue transitioned out of the 'In Review' status.{panel}    This sometimes gives an impression that issues will only be visible in the Control Chart once they have passed through *all* of the columns selected (in this case, one it passed through *In Progress* and *In Review*).    However, this isn't the case.

(!) Development Notes (!)    Q: How will adding a startDate to a previously released version affect the issues that apply to it?  A: (/) If a previously released version has a release date, the new start date will be validated against the release date.    Q: How will adding a startDate affect issues that have been Archived?  A: (/) Changes to version data do not affect issues.    Q: Which timezone setting will the startDate follow, user's or system's?  A: (/) Start date and release date are both stored in the JVM system time zone.    Q: Can you remove the startDate after adding it?  A: (/) Yes.    Q: What is one way to get the startDate to come after the releaseDate?  A: (/) Not possible.    Q: What happens when you add a startDate to a version that has been released but has no releaseDate?  A: (/) Start date can be added without release date.    Q: Is there a special place in the database this column/row will go? Depending on the database used, is there a way for this location to be already taken, and/or do we recycle a location/field ID? We need to protect against overwrites.

"Atlassian Atlassian Software Server","As Patrick, I want to be able to see a projection of possible end date of a version","This is to be calculated using -an average time spent per completed story point (or any other estimation statistic)- average story points per day in a given release so far, plus optimistic and pessimistic variants by adding or subtracting -one standard deviation- 10% from it. (note this was changed because we already return data for story points completed by date but not time per story, and a standard deviation was too big of a difference in most cases and didn't seem to make sense)    # The projections must be displayed somewhere outside of the chart as well.  # Released versions do not need to show projections.  # Show the intended release date on the chart (midnight end of the date specified).  # Do not show calculations of velocity in the page.  # Take NWD into account with the calculation of mean and SD.  # Tooltips for potential targets show type (optimistic, pessimistic) and date.  # At least 10% of total estimated work for the Version must be completed before projections are shown.    (!) Development Notes (!)  Q: What if users are using negative story points?  A: If the predicted release date is in the past, we shouldn't display a prediction at all.    Q: What if any of the rates approach infinity?  A: We probably need to discuss with [~<USER> [~<USER> [~<USER> what is a good point to cut off. At the moment, if the predicted date is infinity, we don't display a prediction. If the most pessimistic date is infinity, we display a flat line and cut the chart off after the predicted date. But as long as it's not infinity, we display it.     Q: What distinguishes a rate that approaches vertical from the scope change events that ARE vertical?  A: (x) Not Answered (Don't really understand this question)    Q: What happens when users change the estimation of their board, or remove it completely?  A: The board will reflect the current estimation.     Q: What if the estimation uses time tracking? Will we calculate deviation in minutes, hours, days? How will this be reflected on the axis?  A: We will calculate units (of estimation) completed per day and use this to project. The axis won't change from what is displayed now: X is time and Y is estimation units.    Q: What if the user is tracking work with Logged Work? Should this rate also be displayed?  A: (x) Not Answered (do you mean time tracking?)    Q: What do we display if a projected line goes significantly into the future before it touches the scope line? Potentially this could be years into the future, but this isn't realistic to display.  A: The chart expands to display the most pessimistic date, unless it's infinity, in which case it expands to show the middle prediction. It could be years.     Q: What happens to the lines if the version has been released?  A: If the version is marked as released or if total scope = total completed scope then we shouldn't display a prediction.     Q: What happens to the lines if the predicted release date is moved to the past?  A: This should never happen.    Q: What happens if the release date is moved into the future?  A: Marking a version as released is separate from displaying a release date. Regardless of whether a release date is assigned, we will try to predict a date if total scope > completed scope and the version is not marked as released in JIRA.    Q: What if the release date is removed?  A: See above.    Q: What happens to the projected lines if issues are removed from the version (resulting in scope change) or deleted entirely (resulting in chart change without history)?  A: The scope line stays horizontal so if scope is removed then it moves down and in theory the release date should move forward.
