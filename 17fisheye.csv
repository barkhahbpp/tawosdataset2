"Atlassian FishEye","Problem with AWT on Windows with AdoptJDK (avatars not displayed).","h3. Issue Summary  When fisheye is installed as a service on Windows with AdoptJDK AWT doesn't work (avatars not displayed).  h3. Steps to Reproduce   # Spin up a fresh Windows machine. Tested on 2019 and 2012.   # Install AdoptJDK (8.0.242.08-hotspot)   # Install Fisheye   # open Services utility, make sure Fisheye is running or start it   # navigate to fisheye web ui and log in    h3. Expected Results  Default avatar is displayed.    h3. Actual Results    1) During Fisheye startup the following stack trace is logged:          2) When rendering a page containing an avatar, no image displayed and the below exception is thrown in the log file:        h3. Workaround    Install another JDK (Oracle) or use different way of installing service (nssm).       h3. Notes    1) Error during startup. OpenJDK around version 1.8.0 update 202, in the {{awt.dll}} library introduced a dependency on 'Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2013'. Download and install this package from the Microsoft website (vcredist_x64.exe). Once installed, the {{java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class java.awt.Toolkit}} error from Fisheye's startup disappears.     2) Error while generating an avatar. It's related with loading SPI modules by javax.imageio.ImageIO. Behaviour is random (stop + start resolves the issue in half of cases).

Version 4.5.1 contains a fix for a bug we found (missing OSGI import caused @PostConstruct to be not executed by Spring, resulting in events not being sent). We decided to re-open this issue in order to check if there is a second bug causing this faulty behaviour. If you happened to upgrade to *4.5.0*, we still recommend upgrading to 4.5.1 or higher, as the fix delivered in 4.5.1 reduces occurrence factor.  {panel}  ----  {panel:title=2018.08.30 Update|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#deebff}  Our investigation revealed that the new customer reports about missing data in the Development panel are caused by the problem with Jira synching mechanism. Crucible correctly pushes events about new commits as well as correctly responds to Jira queries about particular issue key. Therefore, a fix for cached data not being refreshed has to be implemented in Jira, please vote and watch the JSWSERVER-16760 bug report.  {panel}  ----  {panel:title=2018.12.12 Update|titleBGColor=#deebff|bgColor=#deebff}  The JSWSERVER-16760 bug has been fixed and is pending public release in Jira    7.6.11, 7.13.1 and 8.0.0.  {panel}  ----  {panel:title=Note on the Fix}  The fix only ensures that the problem won't happen again to new data. Existing data that got affected in an earlier version won't be fixed automatically. For example, the DevPanel still doesn't show up for some issues that have commit links, but if we make a new commit to the issue then all will show thanks to the fix.  h4. Workaround for a single issue    In such a case, what we can do is to manually delete the fusion cached data related to the issue in the Jira database. For example, if you discover that issue ABC-123 is affected (it has 1 commit but DevPanel doesn't show), you may:   # Run this REST call to confirm it has 1 commit:     # Run this SQL query in Jira db to confirm Jira has an outdated record of it (no commit):    For JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:    (+) If there're more than 1 entry, get the ID of the one whose property_key (or provider_source_id for JIRA 7.9+) is FeCru's applinks ID.   # If the above are confirmed, it's safe to delete the db entry for it to be rewritten with up-to-date data:    For JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:      h4. Workaround to flush the entire cache in Jira   # Run the query to get the information about the app link in Jira:     # Delete the app link from the Jira side   # Delete the app link from the FeCru side   # Take a backup of the Jira database   # Stop Jira to make a DB update   # Delete all entries relating to the FeCru app link from *entity_property*. For example, if fa55abbf-804c-31fd-8d07-1878e61b9766 is the app-link for FeCru:    For JIRA 7.9+, run this query instead:     # Re-install the app link between Jira and FeCru   # Validate that issues now show updated commit information    h5. Important notes on the workaround above   * The workaround must be tested on a copy of Jira before executing in production.   * We have observed that Jira issues will get added to the *entity_property* table as users browse them. At some point, Jira pulled changes for all issues from FeCru as well. This leads us to think this operation may be expensive and makes it safer to run the workaround in production outside of peak hours.   * A few hours after the workaround is run, we need to count the number of records from the query:    {panel}  {panel:title=Original Description}  h3. Steps to reproduce.   # Fisheye 4.5.0 JIRA version doesn't matter   # Perform a smart commit with any kinds of tags of any size    h3. Expected results.    As soon as the commits are available in Fisheye, the JIRA ticket is updated accordingly.  h3. Actual Results    Everything is updated in JIRA except for the Dev Panel. It will take up to 30 minutes for the changesets to show up. After the first branch and commit are available, the number is not updated properly but if you click on the links, all of the branches and changesets appear as expected in the popup.  h3.

Solution    Fisheye allows you to define encoding for Perforce repository.  Before Fisheye 4.6.1 this encoding was used only to process Perforce output. In Fisheye 4.6.1 and later, also input commands are constructed with encoding that is readable by Perforce.    To make sure that the Fisheye input is readable for the Perforce repository,  repository encoding has to be set according to the file paths encoding in the repository.

The code to make the file private is this, in FileSystemUtils:      The 'cacls' command prompts the user if they are sure they want to make the requested change.

"Atlassian FishEye","  Enable X-FRAME-Option in HTTP response headers in order to improve clickjacking protection","Description: Current HTTP headers do not contain the X-FRAME-Option, which helps prevents against Clickjacking attacks. A Clickjacking attack is similar to CSRF in which attacker can hijack a click on a web application from another invisible frame in the browser. Essentially, an attacker can force a user to click on a button that is invisible to him/her.    Exploit Scenario: An attacker crafts a malicious page such that when their victim clicks, they are actually clicking on the link or button in the vulnerable application hosted in an iframe. Thus, an attacker tricks the user into performing an action of the attacker's choosing by directing mouse input to the target application.    Short Term Solution: There are 2 options in the HTTP response header for projection, include:    DENY: If the header contains the DENY option, then the response will not be loaded within a frame.  SAMEORIGIN: If the header contains the SAMEORIGIN option, the response will be loaded within a frame only if the parent page is from the same origin.    Examples below:    Apache:  Add this to your httpd.conf:  Header always append x-frame-options SAMEORIGIN    Note that this is not a panacea for clickjacking.    SAMEORIGIN should be safe to use.
