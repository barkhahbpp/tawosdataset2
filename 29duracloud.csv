Rather it looks at files only and then traverses the ancestors of the file in search of matching directories to exclude.  Thus the DirWalker will unnecessarily slow to a crawl when traversing an excluded directory with large numbers of files.  With the recent commit to resolve duracloud-1129 the exclusion check was moved from DirWalker to ChangedList.

"Lyrasis Dura Cloud","Configure mill to use AWS EFS ","In the current mill configuration we are using instance storage and EBS volumes for temporary disk space.   There are a couple of suboptimal implications of this arrangement:     1.  In the case of the sentinel there is a small possibility of audit log data loss in the sentinel is terminated abruptly since  new log files are pushed to S3 at the end of each log writing session.     2. In order to prevent disks from filling up, every instance must provision enough storage to accommodate the worst case scenario with regard to disk space requirements.  In other words,  since file chunks can be as large as 5GB each node must have at least  threadcount x 5 GB   storage space available in addition to any other overhead ( logs,  programs, os, etc).  Since most instances are using only a fraction of this storage space at any given time, we  are incurring unnecessary storage costs.    Using EFS solves these two problems.   With EFS we don't need to worry about losing data on a disorderly shutdown of the sentinel because EFS data persists across instances.   Regarding the second issue,  you pay for what you use with EFS.   So while EFS is 3x more expensive the EBS per gigabyte,  we expect to use a small fraction of the amount of disk space (probably 1/10th or less) for which  we are currently provisioning.  Another benefit is that we can affordably use many more smaller instances since we don't need to worry about provisioning for adequate disk space.

JPA as a result is overwriting the values we are setting programmatically just before persisting the data causing the event to appear to have occurred later in time than it actually occurred.

"Lyrasis Dura Cloud","Automated duplication of new spaces","When a new space is created in an account which has multiple providers, the mill currently sends an email notification. The next step is for an admin to verify that the space should be duplicated and update the duplication policy accordingly.    Unfortunately, this means that there's a manual step that is required for the system to handle duplication for new spaces. Any content that is added to the primary space needs to be managed after the duplication policy is updated, which is often another manual step. This should all be automated.    To make this happen will require either automated updates to the duplication policies, or a transition in the way duplication policies are used.     One solution would be to change duplication policies to specify a default action (used for all spaces) as well as any exceptions. An account with no dup policy would still perform no duplication, but if an account has a policy, the default action (which would often be to copy from S3 to Glacier) would apply to all spaces unless an exception was listed.",Story,Minor,Closed,"2016-03-28 17:05:06","2016-03-28 17:05:06",4

This task is to transition all DuraCloud content to this new option.    The best way to take advantage of S3 - IA is via bucket lifecycle policies. Because of the additional cost of content deletes in the first 30 days, it would be best to set these policies to transition content from S3 Standard storage to S3 - IA storage after the content has been stored for 30 days. This policy should be created when a new space is created (via the S3StorageProvider)    As part of this work, the current S3 task which transitions content to Reduced Redundancy storage should be replaced with a task that adds the bucket policy for S3 - IA to an existing bucket. To complete this transition, a script will need to be written which uses this task to update all current accounts.

"Lyrasis Dura Cloud","Cannot configure or turn off logging of Retrier in ContentStoreImpl","The ContentStoreImpl currently has hardcoded settings for how it logs errors encountered during retries.  Unfortunately, this is not ideal for all use cases of the API.  For example, in the Replication Task Suite, we use ContentStoreImpl.getContentProperties() method as a way to tell whether content already exists in DuraCloud. If that content does not exist, we expect to receive a NotFoundException. This lets us perform logic like: If content exists in DuraCloud, see what checksum DuraCloud reports. If DuraCloud checksum differs from local checksum, re-upload the content.  Unfortunately, however, getContentProperties() logs this same warning message to log4j 4 times in a row (1 + 3 retries) if the content does NOT yet exist in DuraCloud:  2014-07-14 16:46:28,336 WARN  org.duracloud.client.ContentStoreImpl @ Error attempting to get properties '<EMAIL>' in 'dspace-dev-backup' due to: Response code was 404, expected value was 200. Response body value: null  This causes the logs for the Replication Task Suite to actually fill up with unnecessary warnings from the DuraCloud v3.1.1 API. For example, anytime we want to upload NEW content to DuraCloud, we first check if it already exists (which logs that error x 4) before the new content is uploaded. The logged warnings would cause unnecessary worry for anyone looking at the logs -- in reality they are harmless in this scenario, as the content obviously doesn't exist before it is first uploaded.  It looks like the WARN message is generated by doGetContentProperties here: https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L904  It is then repeated 4 times as a log.warn in the default execute() method (which is configured to do 3 retries): https://github.com/duracloud/duracloud/blob/master/storeclient/src/main/java/org/duracloud/client/ContentStoreImpl.java#L216  Ideally, there should be some way to configure the logging in the ContentStoreImpl. I like that this same task is retried 3 times. But in many scenarios, I'd rather it just throw me a final Error if all retries failed, rather than logging the same error message multiple times in a row.   If logging cannot be easily configurable, then switching the default execute() method to just do a log.debug would be better. That way I can see the underlying error if I turn on debugging, but by default my logs don't get filled with the same errors repeated.  NOTE: This was discovered while attempting to upgrade the DSpace Replication Task Suite to use DuraCloud API version 3.1.1 (JARS: storeclient, storeprovider, common). Unfortunately, until logging is cleaned up in some way, it's unlikely I'll release the upgraded Replication Task Suite code.",Bug,Minor,Closed,"2014-07-14 23:53:21","2014-07-14 23:53:21",2

I was thinking that this could be accomplished with an html/css/javascript app that is stored in one of the user's spaces, and allows them to select a space (if that's actually necessary, could be hard coded to the one that is their image library) and view a set of images. The javascript would need to make calls to the DuraCloud REST API to get the list of content items and display each one. The images would likely be scaled down a bit, to make browsing easier, and clicking on them would display the (slightly) larger size. The REST API would also be used to allow paging through the content items (and not trying to display too many at once). The option to specify a prefix for filtering would need to be there, and the user would need to be able to see the full content ID of the item they are viewing, since that will be the link back to the full size archival image on their internal system.

Ideally either clicking directly on the checkbox or the space name will select the space (add the checkmark) and both actions will behave identically: they will display the content of the space with all the other associated actions.

Otherwise the download URI would be available via a status query using the request handle.  Once the archive had been downloaded and verified the user could then make a call to remove download site.  If no call was made after a standard expiration time, the download would be removed automatically.

A comment from the State of North Carolina about how they envision this feature:  Our ideal upload tool would allow us to specify a local directory to update in the cloud, and the tool would then identify and upload new files (new files defined by file name and path), and alert us to any files that have changed (same file name and path but new checksum hash) and not upload the files that have changed (or upload them in a way that doesn't overwrite the files in the cloud).

So, in the DSpace use case, when doing a partial restore, you may wish to retrieve only a portion of the files from the space (rather than having to pull down all of them).  I would like to be able to request specific files by name (or by a comma separated list of names).  A regular expression could also work, but a list of exact names would seemingly meet the needs for DSpace. So, for DSpace, the AIP files stored in DuraCloud will have very specific names, similar to:  <EMAIL> <EMAIL>  Generally the AIP name is a specific format: <DSpace-Object-Type>@<DSpace-Object-identifier>.zip  So, if a DSpace install wanted to restore just a particular object (or small set of objects), it might be nice if they can request *just* those objects by name (rather than having to pull down their entire space).  I just know this is a specific case that's currently missing -- we either need a simple solution from the Retrieval tool, or we need a DSpace-specific tool to support partial content restores (where a user only wants to restore a particular set of items or a single collection).",Story,Minor,Closed,"2010-11-11 21:51:37","2010-11-11 21:51:37",2

The service has failed when running with 1 instance of each instance size. The service has also failed in a test running an xlarge instance with only 2 mappers.  Watching the memory consumption on a small instance while the service is running shows that a significant amount of memory is consumed by the mogrify step (which is run using a bash script to call ImageMagick) - all swap space was consumed, and less than 10% of memory remained available.  Testing has indicated that the size of images being transformed likely plays a role in the failures. Moving the two largest Rhodes files to another space (all of the rest of the tiffs being under 115 MB) allowed the transformation to complete successfully using 3 xlarge instances. Running the conversion over the same set with only 1 instance (regardless of size) still failed, however.

"Lyrasis Dura Cloud","Content does not complete if list size >= 1000","When the number of content items within a space exceeds 1000 and the maxResults parameter is set to 1000 or greater (1000 is the default), then ContentIterator.java eventually terminates early. This is because the underlying query to the storage provider is maxResults+1 to account for the possibility that the space metadata content object may be in the listing. Since the S3 client will only return a max of 1000 items regardless of the maxResults parameter, the call with 1001 effectively turns into a call for 1000 items. The logic in ContentIterator is terminating if the number of items in the listing returned is less than the maxResults parameter, which is the case when 1000 items are returned and one is removed (i.e. the space metadata object).",Bug,Major,Closed,"2010-08-31 01:53:07","2010-08-31 01:53:07",1

Would you be able to do some testing to see if duradmin actually needs this dependency or not. If we do need it, then we can pull it into our own Duraspace maven repository. Since it probably is a runtime dependency with the AJAX tooling, could you remove it from your local maven repository, place an exclude element in your duradmin pom.xml, and run through the application to see if it is actually being used anywhere? ...and naturally double check you local repository to make sure it did not slip back in.

DuraStore should facilitate this by handling the chunking of large files into smaller files during transfer. Files will need to be stitched back together on download as well.

"Lyrasis Dura Cloud","Indexing service for space/content properties/tags (Search) ","Users expect to be able to find the objects they have stored via a search box in the UI.    The work includes listening for changes to spaces/content and making the calls to have the information included in the search engine index as well as exposing ways for the index to be queried. A search engine must be selected and deployed, and there will need to be a method for generating the initial index.    Prior to working this task, a choice will need to be made as to the indexing tools used. AWS CloudSearch ([http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch]) is one candidate. Alternatively, it would be possible to make direct use of the existing relational database to provide a simplified search available.    This task does not include updates to the UI or REST API to support users querying the index, but how the search will be exposed should be considered as part of this work.",Story,Minor,Open,"2010-01-04 17:59:54","2010-01-04 17:59:54",8
