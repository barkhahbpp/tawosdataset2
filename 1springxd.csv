"Spring XD","Improve support for custom headers when using Kafka Message Bus","I understand Kafka natively does not have the concept of message headers. However, Spring Integration messages do and a lot of SI components are built specifically for dealing with message headers (header-enricher, header-filter, header-value-router, etc...). In addition, message headers are very useful for tracking meta-information about messages as they progress through a system.  With the implementation of https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-3621; Spring XD has limited support for custom headers when using Kafka as a transport. I say limited, because it is required to list all custom headers explicitly in servers.yml in order for the headers to be retained by the MessageBus.  This is less than ideal because it means that it is necessary to know all potential custom header values a user will require before starting the environment.  It would be nice to extend this functionality so that it is not necessary to list custom headers in the configuration. Instead, when operating in mode=embeddedHeaders, Spring XD will simply embeds ALL headers in the Kafka message. Or alternatively, allow for a wildcard in the 'headers' configuration option so that it is not necessary to exhaustively list all possible custom header values prior to starting the system.",Improvement,Minor,"To Do","2015-12-14 22:35:13","2015-12-14 22:35:13",5

Note: I verified this SSL configuration works with a simple SDG client against the XD server. (Use SDG 1.6.2, and gemfire 8.0.0).  Also, the gemfire-json-server example in the XD reference works as expected without the SSL configuration.   This may to be related to the module using a its own class loader. `java.lang.IllegalStateException: A connection to a distributed system already exists in this VM` happens because there are 2 instances of DistributedSystem created (one for each class loader?).

In certain cases I want to use direct binding to remove communication with the message bus and deploy all modules to all containers with the aim of improving performance. I’ve found that even when using direct binding, XD still communicates with Redis when it shouldn’t need to. This could have an impact on performance.  This is easily reproducible in our 2 container cluster as follows:  Use the redis-cli monitor command to monitor Redis.  Create and deploy a simple stream with direct binding:    As expected both modules get deployed to both nodes. Testing shows messages sent to the http endpoint of one container always come out in the log for that container implying direct binding is in play as expected.  However once the streams are deployed the Redis monitor starts showing a Redis queue being accessed from both XD conatiners:    This shouldn’t need to happen in direct binding.

I'm sure you guys have a good reason to add the prefix  but I don't see why. Unfortunately is  annoying when you are developing in a local VM where you can test the  simple authentication and after move the job to dev/prod environments with kerberos auth, the above because you must change your sqooptasklet configuration injecting the new parameters. If the SqoopTasklet allows inject those parameters directly from the hadoop.properties file you don't need change tasklet  configurations to run your jobs with different authentication methods.

"Spring XD","Be aware of exceptions thrown in a stream","Currently, if a module in a stream throws an exception, the stream flow is broken, but the stream's creator is not notified or warned about the issue, unless a direct monitoring of the logs is performed.  This could work when an administrator is taking care of the whole life cycle of any stream, but it doesn't work when Spring XD is being used by external services with no human intervention.  It would be necessary some sort of notification mechanism so when any issue raises in the execution of a stream, its creator can react and decide on how to handle it.  For instance, I have an application that uses Spring XD to load data from different sources into HDFS. In my application, you simply define a type of source and the destiny in HDFS, without the user knowing that Spring XD is under the hoods. If the user defines, for example, a Twitter source, then I define a twitterstream as a source for a new stream with a sink in HDFS. However, if anything goes wrong, I have no way to let my user know about the issue: an authentication issue, the dreaded 420 response from the Twitter API, etc. If I could somehow be notified about the issue, then I could provide that information to my user so she could fix the issue or at least understand what is going on.  I've seen that the REST API will support an endpoint to check the current status of a stream, but it is not yet available and it would require my application to be polling constantly the stream, with all the disadvantages compared to a pushing mechanism.",Story,Major,"To Do","2015-09-30 21:44:47","2015-09-30 20:44:47",100

"Spring XD","Spike: Design a tasks repository","h2. Narrative As a developer, I'd like to be able to run a boot jar as a task on CF and obtain the result reliably.  h2. Back story Currently Lattice/Diego's tasks implementation provides the ability to run things as short lived tasks.  However, obtaining the result of said task can be an issue.  There are two ways to do so:  # Poll for the result. # Register a callback URL to be called once the task completes.  Since a task is only available for a short time after its completion before it is deleted, polling can run the risk of missing the result completely.  When you consider the fact that the provided GUIDs that identify tasks can be re-used polling becomes a precarious option.  Registering a callback URL would be a better option, however there are no good guarantees that the message will be delivered.  The service will try to execute the callback until it's successful or the task is cleaned up.  Successful is defined in this case as anything other than a 502 or a 503 return code.  In order for Spring XD to be able to support Diego tasks, a more durable option for maintaining the result of tasks will need to be developed.  *Note:* The outcome of this spike may be feature requests for the CF/Diego team.",Story,Major,Done,"2015-07-24 12:36:56","2015-07-24 11:36:56",8

An example could be that I use MySql for my databases.  I want to be able to configure the MySql driver once and have all modules use it.  h2. Back story Spring Batch uses a database to store job state (the job repository).  This is a shared resource across all jobs (both custom developed and OOTB).  In order to support OOTB jobs, we'll need to have a way for users to provide the db driver to each module.

While constructing the steps of jobs themselves would be difficult in this manor, creating flows of jobs (essentially a job that consists only of job steps) would be very useful.  It would allow a developer to create something like the following:    This approach also allows the existing packaging/module registry/etc to work out of the box.

Narrative As a developer, I'd like a job module to be bootstrapped when the job is launched and shut down once it is complete instead of the current behavior of bootstrapping the context when the module is deployed regardless of if it's being used so that I can achieve better resource utilization.  h2. Back story While streams are never ending, batch jobs have a true lifecycle with a beginning and and end.  By having a job bootstrapped when it's not executing, it eats up precious resources.  For example, if I have a job that creates connections to a database via a connection pool, the job module will hold those connections from the moment it's deployed to the moment it's undeployed, even if the job isn't being executed.  A more efficient use of resources would be to have the job module provide just enough to receive the launch request and then bootstrap the job's context  h2.

"Spring XD","module.*.count > 1 duplicates messages on taps","Using module.name.count > 1 when deploying taps causes duplication of messages in those modules. This impacts balancing of the containers and modules in a cluster as messages should not be duplicated across modules if the same module is deployed twice to two containers in order to spread the load.  We use taps quite heavily in our project mainly for analytics of the life feed in real time but due to issue we have discovered and described in this bug we are currently facing a limitation where heavily processing modules can not be load balanced across the cluster as they are causing duplication of the messages and therefore the same module deployed to two  containers would still process the same message twice.  To demonstrate the problem please see test case scenario set up below:  h4. 1. Environment  - Spring-XD version 1.1.1-RELEASE - Running two spring-xd containers and one spring-xd admin  h4. 2. Set up  Stream definition is as follows:   {quote}stream create --name test-module-count --definition syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | log stream deploy --name test-module-count --properties module.*.count=2 stream create --name tap-test-module-count --definition tap:stream:test-module-count.syslog-udp > transform --expression='payload.toString() + \TAPPED\' | log stream deploy --name tap-test-module-count --properties module.*.count=2{quote}   Please refer to the screen shots attached to see that after deploying those two streams we have:  - streams successfully deployed ( module-count-spring-xd-streams.png ) - streams successfully deployed with count=2 to both containers ( module-count-spring-xd-containers.png )  - 5 queues created in Rabbit ( module-count-rabbit.png ) where two were created for the syslog-udp collector as a result of using module.syslog-udp.count=2 - this is causing messages to be duplicated. Normally the expectation would be to have only one queue for the tap  h4. 3. Test input data  I have sent a very simple UDP message to the listening udp collector running on second container:   {quote}echo test-module-count >> /dev/udp/host02/5140{quote}  h4. 4. Test output data in the logs ( module-count-container01.log and module-count-container02.log )  h5.

This is configured in $XD_HOME/config/servers.yml however so far group configuration never influenced test outcome. 4) Create and deploy a test stream using following XD Shell commands: stream create --name test-zookeeper-failover --definition syslog-udp --port=5140 | transform | file --dir='/opt/pivotal/spring-xd/xd/output' stream deploy --name test-zookeeper-failover --properties module.syslog-udp.criteria=groups.contains('HA1'),module.syslog-udp.count=2,module.file.criteria=groups.contains('SA'),module.file.count=3,module.transform.criteria=groups.contains('SA') 5) Ensure that test stream works and handles traffic on UDP port 5140 6) Shutdown one of the Zookeeper nodes by issuing a stop command. 7) Two Spring XD containers were not affected and remained in Spring XD cluster. 8) One Spring XD container was kicked out of Spring XD cluster and was no longer visible on Spring XD admin Web UI. Modules previously deployed to this container were not redeployed to other cluster members. 9) On the failed Spring XD container we have observed CONNECTION_SUSPEND, CONNECTION_RECONECTED and CHILD_REMOVE Zookeeper events (attached is container-log.txt). Please note that Java process is still running and we see “ConnectionStateManager-0 server.ContainerRegistrar - Waiting for supervisor to clean up prior deployments” messages. 10) Spring XD admin failed with exception in DepartingContainerModuleRedeployer (attached is admin-log.txt).  11) We have observed that departing container node in Zookeeper (/sa/deployments/modules/allocated/1d3fd4cc-5a70-47ed-b4f3-22deef1f4d4f/) had no children. We did this after few minutes so we are not sure at which point it was cleared.  12) Restarting failed Spring XD container fixed the problem, modules were correctly redeployed.

There is also an issue of having to restart the node when theres been a problem with uploading/removing a module.  When using SpringXD in single node on windows, i uploaded a custom module and then added a folder and property file for it in the module configuration directory as specified in the documentation. When i went to delete the module using the command in the SpringXD admin console, it would say that it was successfull, but when then listing the modules, it would still be listed. If i tried to upload a new version of that same module, i would get an error stating that module already existed with the same name. I would check the custom modules directory and my jar would not be there. I would then have to manually delete the module configuration directory and restart SpringXD before being able to upload a new module, having to replace my module configuration each time.  Seems like there are three things wrong here: * should the presence of a module configuration alone inform SpringXD of a modules existence? * should one have to delete a module configuration before uploading a new version of the module? * when getting module deletion/upload errors, should one have to restart spring xd node to get it to allow the upload again?",Bug,Minor,"To Do","2015-04-24 14:17:14","2015-04-24 13:17:14",1

This is internal only, and would not impact users who are used to seeing log4j.properties. An additional step is to replace log4j with logback. This change would be visible to end users but will provide us greater affinity with boot and improve the developer experience. If we make this change it should go into 1.2 GA.

Otherwise, with a local bus, only one partition would run at a time.  When further work was done to support other buses, this was removed and the bus was used to control partition concurrency.  The {{LocalMessageBus}} was changed to use an unbounded task executor; this was wrong because now all partitions ran at once.  Further changes to the local bus changed the task executor to be pooled, but with default properties that mean only one thread is used.  Further, the pool configuration is bus-wide so you can't use that configuration to select the concurrency for an individual job.  The bottom line is that the local bus is not suitable for partitioned batch jobs; it was not anticipated that it would be used for this scenario. With 1.0.x too many partitions run (all); with 1.1.x only one thread runs (by default).  In the local bus, we need to use a configurable, dedicated, bounded task executor for each batch job.

"Spring XD","Parent Modules","Thinking about the UBS(?) scenario that MP described. They want all their Cassandra modules to share a connection, leading to the need for a parent context for those modules. We could introduce a parent module for this purpose. The module declares a parent in its properties which likely ends up as a parent module definition in the module definition. When the child module is deployed, its parent must be deployed first if it is not already (i.e., parent is a singleton per container). The module sets that as it's parent context.  We would have to make sure things happen in the correct order so the global context is the parent of the parent (ad infinitum). The alternative is to add a module parent context to the XD hierarchy which is extensible, but this is more elegant IMHO.  Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader, eliminating the need to install common jars in an HDFS path (basically the approach I described https://jira.spring.io/browse/XD-2420)   MP : >> Also, in cases that don't require singleton bean definitions, the parent could package and provide common jars to children, e.g., we set the parent module's classloader as the parent classloader This approach does not offer some of the advantages offered by a central yaml config noted in the JIRA . But it is simpler in many ways. The developer just installs a parent module containing dependent jars and sets that as a parent in the child modules. This requires no additional infrastructure. To address the hadoop scenario we discussed, we would need another level of indirection so the parent of the hdfs modules is bound to the configured hadoop distro.   e.g. something like  parent = ${xd.hadoop.distro} in module properties  MF: Possibly the parent modules could go in the common directory? They should be considered abstract also - in the same sense as abstract bean definitions in a Spring context (and they should only be started on demand when needed by at least one concrete child module - then destroyed when the last child module is destroyed).  Maybe this would also allow us to wrap up those xml files that currently live in common so that they are treated as parent modules?  MF: Yea, that sounds good wrt to common.  Also it might be a good idea to enable spring to throw an error if it finds more than one bean of the same name in the application context - i think that applies to searching in parent contexts as well.  this would avoid the 'last one wins' rule and give more deterministic behavior.

See sqoop documentation [here|http://sqoop.apache.org/docs/1.4.5/SqoopUserGuide.html#_incremental_imports]. The job will need to maintain some state between executions in order to decide the start point for the next data load.   The jdbchdfs job definition could take the following 2 new options.   h5. checkColumn  optional Specifies the column to be examined when determining which rows to import. (the column should not be of type CHAR/NCHAR/VARCHAR/VARNCHAR/ LONGVARCHAR/LONGNVARCHAR). Column should be numeric or timestamp. h5. lastValue  optional If specified this will override any data saved from previous job runs. If not specified will take the saved max-value from the last job run. If no last job run data is available then it will not be an incremental load and all the data which satisfies the query will be used.  Sqoop provides 2 modes of operation for incremental load, 'append' and 'lastModified'. For jdbchdfs the job will always append as it is writing to a hdfs file.  Example: To import data from the database table some_table which has a last update column called lastUpdated, you could use.   The batch job should also be capable of being partitioned to run in parallel across multiple containers",Improvement,Major,Done,"2014-11-04 08:38:48","2014-11-04 08:38:48",5

"Spring XD","NoNode Exception in SpringXD Admin","Sorry to set it Blocker; but the problem makes SpringXD unusable. We are getting this weird, NoNode exception on the status ZNode. Example and Log given below. Once this happens, both streams and jobs cannot be deployed. For whatever reason the status znode goes missing.    The only way for us to get the cluster back to working state, is to clear the zk znode /xd tree and restart spring-xd. At which point, we have to recreate all our streams and jobs back again..   /xd/deployments/streams/testCreateStream_SrcHttp_SinkFile1413234903170/status  NoNode Exception:  13 Oct 2014 14:16:16,044   INFO DeploymentSupervisorCacheListener-0 server.InitialDeploymentListener -

"Spring XD","REST representation of an aggregate-counter can lead to mixed up output","The current representation of REST resources of time-series data (e.g. aggregate counter) can lead to problems in consuming applications.  Despite the time series data provided by the counts data structure is logically ordered by key (timestamps) it doesn't guarantee an ordering, since many consuming applications interpret JSON data as an unordered map like data structure.  Because of this consuming applications have to apply special ordering / transformation logic to get the data in an chronologically ordered fashion. It would be helpful if one could configure the rendering of the time series data, e.g. as a list of json object like: {code:json} {  ts:Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014  ,value: 42 }   xd:>stream create test --definition http | filter --expression=payload.contains('pivotal') | log  xd:>stream create test_tap --definition tap:stream:test.filter > aggregate-counter  xd:>http post --data Hello pivotal data labs #...some more data...  xd:>aggregate-counter display test_tap --resolution minute   AggregateCounter=test_tap   -----------------------------  -  -----   TIME                           -  COUNT   Sun Oct 12 23:10:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:11:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:12:23 CEST 2014  |  0   Sun Oct 12 23:13:23 CEST 2014  |  0   ...

"Spring XD","Add support for estimating the median value of a data stream.","Often it is useful to have access to the median value for fields of a data stream since they are more robust with respect to outliers.  The median is defined as the value of a dataset such that, when sorted, 50% of the data is smaller than the value and 50% of the data is larger then the value. Ordinarily this is difficult to calculate on a stream because it requires the collection and sorting of all data.  The median of a data stream can be approximated with a technique called stochastic averaging. To approximate the median value of a data stream one could use the following approach: Given the current estimate of the median {{M}}. If the next observed value in the stream is larger than {{M}}, increase the current estimate by {{r}} (= the learning rate). If it is smaller, decrease the estimate by {{r}}. When {{M}} is close to the median, it increases as often as it decreases, and therefore it stabilizes.

Couple of thoughts that come to mind : 1. stack trace logging can happen in debug mode esp for message level logging on containers 2. if a stream is failing on all containers can we undeploy the stream? this would require some sort of alerting to notify admins or owners of these streams.

A service activator works for a POJO backed sink. Writing a source that is not backed by an existing inbound channel adapter is a bit more involved and requires more than basic familiarity with SI. It should be possible for XD to automatically create a polling source by wiring a Java method to an inbound adapter configured with a poller.

The above mentioned classes have dependencies on classes found in mongo-driver and spring-data-mongodb. Due to the fact that Spring Batch classes are loaded in the parent class loader, adding the complementary jars to the module will not make their dependencies visible to the deployment, resulting in a NoClassDefFoundError on spring-data-mongodb classes in this scenario.  There are a few possible solutions:   - requiring the user to add the missing jars to the shared libs folder - this is the straightforward solution, but has the disadvantage of putting the onus on enhancing the distribution on the user (who must have knowledge of the proper version(s) to include); - including the missing jars in the distribution (which can potentially increase its size to satisfy an optional scenario); - increasing the granularity of the packaged Spring Batch distribution and allowing the users to add the classes on demand;  Essentially, this applies to any other dependencies of Spring Batch that are not part of the distribution.

Here is the scenario for a stream http | transform | log, with XD_MODULE_CONFIG_LOCATION and XD_MODULE_CONFIG_NAME using their default values.  In, ${xd.config.home}/modules/modules.yml, I have: processor:   transform:     expression: 'Inside modules.yml'  and, in, ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties, I have: expression: 'First module: inside transform.properties'  Now, I deploy this stream: http | transform | log.  Lets say, I have another stream that uses the transform module, but this time I want to change the expression in ${xd.config.home}/modules/processor/transform/transform.properties to, expression: 'Second module'  Now, when the stream containing this transform module gets deployed, it uses the same transform.properties that is used by the previously deployed transform module.  What I understand from this behavior is that, the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver caches the module environments for a given module type and name. When the same module is deployed from a given stream again, it uses the stored module environment and doesn't refresh/load the property sources from the module config locations mentioned above. Though this is good in one way that same module environment is re-used, changing the externalized module config properties would have no affect after the first module of same type/name is deployed.  Though the EnvironmentAwareModuleOptionsMetadataResolver is used by both admin and container, this JIRA focuses more on the container side.

At many points, this doc could link back to items that we also need to add to the main User Guide, such as the description of ContainerMatcher as the strategy for an Admin to determine which Container(s) should deploy a given Module, since that ContainerMatcher is used not only for the initial deployment, but also any redeployment that may be necessary.",Improvement,Minor,Done,"2014-04-02 06:34:53","2014-04-02 05:34:53",6

In the end, there should be no need for a ParsingContext enum but rather, more explicitly named methods and dedicated classes if that seems like the right approach.  the StreamDefinition should be composed of ModuleDescriptors (that name is not set in stone) and other Stream-level metadata like source/sink channels  consider merging some of StreamFactory code there, and the rest into StreamDeployer  merge ModuleDescriptor and ModuleDeploymentRequest as part of this effort (again, a new name could be considered, but ModuleDescriptor should take precedence over ModuleDeploymentRequest), and note in the process that ModuleDescriptor was originally designed to be immutable (taking constructor args), but as we migrated the prototype code into XD itself, this was violated.

The reason for the impact is the message needs to be serialized + transported + deserialized to other members even if there is no one listening.  This serialized + transported + deserialized processes happens for each step in a flow - source | process | sink.  Recommend creating some kind of protocol for wiretaps that allows members to know if there is someone listening in the grid so they will emit the data.

With this change, IF a client connect string is provided explicitly, the embedded ZooKeeper server should not be started, but instead the client connection should be established using that explicitly provided connect string. SEE the todo comment above the `SpringApplicationBuilder admin` line within `SingleNodeApplication`.  *distributed:*  Currently, when running in distributed mode, the client connect string is hardcoded to `localhost:2181`. Obviously that is only a short term solution since a real-world distributed runtime would span multiple machines (including the ZooKeeper ensemble itself). That is also why the connect string must support a comma-delimited list of `host:port` values (for redundancy), but the constructor for `ZooKeeperConnection` that accepts a client connect string already supports that via the underlying `CuratorFramework` builder.  With this change, a command-line argument for the client connect string will be passed into the `ZooKeeperConnection` constructor, within the configuration (e.g. SEE the todo statement within `ContainerServerApplication.DistributedZooKeeperConnectionConfiguration`).",Story,Minor,Done,"2014-03-12 07:29:44","2014-03-12 07:29:44",4

Create a job definition from a job module by providing a name and properties that apply to all job instances can be configured at this point.  The job is not yet deployed 3. Deploy the job to an xd-container.  A job instance can not be created by sending a message to a job queue that contains optional runtime job parameters 4. Launch a job by sending a message to the job queue with job parametres.  A Job Instance is created, representing a specific run of the job.  A Job Instance is the Job Definition plus the runtime job parameters.  You can query for the Job Instances associated with a given job name 5. The job is executed creating a Job Exection object that captures the success or failure of the job.  You can query for the Job Executions associated with a given job name. 6. Undeploy a job.

For example if the stream data was for car purchases some fields might be colour, make and model.  When analysing the aggregate data I dont just want to know how many were sold on Monday, but how many of each make or how many of each colour,  or how many of a particular colour, make AND model. This would allow a dashboard type client to 'drill down' into each dimension or combination of dimensions (in real time without executing batch queries against the raw data)  Ideally the aggregate counter would be specified as   stream create --name mytap --definition tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --fieldNames=colour,make,model  The keys would be dynamically created according to the field values in each record (ie in a similar way to the field value counter you would not need to predefine field values) and keys would be created for all combinations of the fields specified eg the record   { colour:silver , make:VW , model : Golf }   would increment the following key counters (in addtion to the existing time buckets)  <existing base counter - ie all fields for this time bucket> colour:black make:VW model:Golf colour:black.make:VW colour:black.model:Golf make:VW.model:Golf colour:black.make:VW.model:Golf  ie the actual keys would look something like  aggregatecounters.mycount.make:VW.model:Golf.201307 etc  This may seem like it would generate a lot of key combinations but in practice the data generated will still be massively less than the raw data, and keys will only be created if that combination occurs in a time period.  Also some fields may be dependent on each other (such as make and model in the above example) so the amount of possibilites for those composite keys would be a lot less that the number of one times the number of the other.

However the data may already have a timestamp in it (eg streams from activity events on a website).  It would be useful as an alternative approach to be able to specify this field to aggregate on.   This would have the following benefits:  1) The aggregate counts would be more accurate as they would reflect the acutal event times and not have any lag from an intermediate messgaging system they might have passed through. 2) If for whatever reason XD is down, comes back up and starts pulling queued messages from the messaging system the aggregate counter will reflect the correct event time. Currently you would get a gap and then a spike as a backlog of messages would get allocated to the current aggregate count. 3) Old data could be rerun through XD still creating the correct aggregate counts.  Configuration would be something like   stream create --name mytap --definition tap:mystream > aggregatecounter --name=mycount --timestampField=eventtime  without the timestampfield it would behave as currently.

This story proposes to introduce a richer model for module options, which could take the following xml representation (keeping in mind that there would be an underlying set of classes that could also apply to e.g. @Configuration approach):    So, the very first obvious benefit is providing help metadata. The second one is an easy way to list available option names, without resorting to brittle PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer hacks (we wouldn't for example detect xd.stream.name or XD_TRANSPORT as a valid option)  One could also specify defaults/computations, this time benefiting from SpEL everywhere:   Lastly, this opens the door to better type checking / combinations / optionality support:   The 'valid' attribute can e.g. be evaluated by SpEL.  Some final remarks: - That construct can be compatible with our current approach by behaving as a PropertySource itself (instead of creating a PropertySource, the StreamPlugin would give this new bean the java.util.Properties) - Plugins could benefit from a hook in that construct and advertise the fact that they expect/provide new options (e.g. --inputType)  There is a slight problem though, which is that if this construct lives in the same AppContext as the module definition itself, then the AppContext needs to be refreshed for the logic to kick in. One could circumvent that using profiles, or we could rely on a different filename convention (e.g. <module>-params.xml)   ",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-10-14 08:25:02","2013-10-14 07:25:02",10

Instead of putting all libs in one directory and an XML in another, it could be a fat jar including some metadata file pointing to either an XML or to a JavaConfig configuration class inside the jar. Some more words why I think it's important to have something like that: Spring XD can be very well used in the enterprise, and at least for job modules it's likely to have some dependencies. So what do you have to do now to deploy such a module? Build a jar with your build process, then get it from your repository, unpack it and somehow find the relevant XML to copy it into the appropriate folder, then inspect the POM to find out what all the dependencies are, direct and transient, and get them from your repository to copy them into the appropriate folder. And of course, copy the jar. And when using Spring XD in distributed mode, you have to do it several times. With the approach mentioned above you just build your fat jar with your build process and distribute it to all your nodes, nothing complicated.  And if you implement it like that it's easy to have a JavaConfig support that's almost the same.",Improvement,Minor,Done,"2013-09-11 18:07:02","2013-09-11 17:07:02",9

"Spring XD","Change rabbitmq sink to use routing-key-expression instead of routing-key","The current rabbitmq sink uses the attribute routing-key, which defaults to the name of the stream.  This should be change to use the attribute routing-key-expression so that the routing-key can be determined using SpEL.  This will enable a dynamic evaluation of the routing-key based on message payload/header.  *Implementation Suggestions*  This hopefully should be changing the XML description of the sink to     routing-key-expression=${routingKey:'${xd.stream.name}'}  This way, the ${xd.stream.name} is surrounded by a single quote to indicate a string literal to SpEL in the default case.    *How to verify it works.*  One of the simple uses of this is to create a routing key based on payload.  In a distributed word-count example, the hashcode of a word would be sent to a certain number of processing modules that would perform the count. The idea is that the same word is sent to the same node over and over again, in particular if in-memory counters or state is computed - using centralized redis counters this wouldn't be necessary in the case of only counter state.  The stream   http | rabbit --routingKey='word-' + payload.hashCode() % 3  is an example of a stream that can be used to verify that messages published to a direct exchange will have routing keys of the value word-0, word-1, and word-2.  Binding a queue to each of these routing keys, one can observe the contents of messages in the queue to make sure that words are being routed to the appropriate queue, e.g. publishing hello as the payload of an http request should always appear in the same queue.  The rabbitmq admin console can be used for this purpose. ",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-09-02 23:31:17","2013-09-02 22:31:17",3

The tail module should be checked to see how many lines of text it will read into memory at once.  The file module node with the file-to-string transformer will only work for small files as it keep the whole file in memory.    If there is a big memory inefficiency in using the tail file input source, create a new story to investigate how to have a file based input source that creates a message per line of text or something that is will not result in excessive memory usage.

Jobs only become visible to XD’s ‘jobs list’ command once they have been ‘created’.    Creating a Job in XD is an opportunity to specify additional values to any property placeholders in the job bean definition.  This isn’t part of spring-batch-admin.  We will not worry about the creation of job definition in this story.  Assume that they have been created already and that the GET for /jobs works as it does now for Spring XD.   We should however, make sure that there is always a replacement of the job name in the job bean definition to match the ‘--name’ specified in the command line.  That is “job create --name myjob --description “thisfunkyjob”  will use ‘myjob to replace <job id=${xd.stream.name} in the file thisfunkyjob.xml  *Implementation Suggestions*  This should hopefully just be a matter of changing job definition files to follow the naming pattern.  <job id=${xd.stream.name} … />  *How to verify it works*  1.

"Spring XD","REST API for Job Management","Spring Batch Admin provides a complete, but outdated implementation style, which covers the full administrative lifecycle of batch jobs, their creation, stop/start, and retrieving information about previous job executions and the status of currently executing job executions.  SpringXD has a different way of deploying, starting, and stopping jobs - by sending messages to containers that run the batch job.  However, the reporting state of a job is still stored in a common job repository.  The purpose of this story is to take the first step to merging in the existing code base that focuses only on the retrieval of information from Spring Batch Admin’s Job controller.  The current ‘REST API’ style of these commands should stay as close to the original spring batch admin style as possible.  There are several reasons for this 1. It works, and time to springone is short, and we mgmt has expectations around deliverables that we must strive to meet. 2. It gives Andrew a working contract to start developing a UI 3.

"Spring XD","Use ParentLastClassLoader to create the Modules ApplicationContext.","The ParentLastClassloader is located in the spring-hadoop project.  It will resolve classes first looking at the child context and then the parent.  This works well for XD since the we want and dependencies of the module to be considered first and if not found, resolve against the parent. It would be possible to even include other versions of .jars already in the parent classloaders (e.g. Spring Integration jars), but for now, we will not immediately test that case.  SimpleModule needs to change to that we can pass in the classloader to use for creating the application context. The current implementation creates a GenericApplicationContext as a field initializer...that should change to be in the ctor.  ModuleDeployer should implement .BeanClassLoaderAware.  The classloader passed in to the BeanClassLoaderAware callback will be used as the ‘parent’ when creating the ParentLastClassloader.    The URL[] to pass into ParentLastClassloader should be ‘null’ or an empty array in this case of an older style module.  (Hopefully ParentLastClassloader  allows that type of fallback).  *Implementation Suggestions:* The ModuleDeployer code is where the application context for the module is defined and instantiated.   Here is a possible impl path.  1. Assuming we can always use ParentLastClassloader (even for older style modules), then the ModuleDescriptor needs to return an array of URL[] locations for the module, getURL().  This is passed into the cto for SimpleModule.  The ctor then creates a new application context, creates the parentclassloader, sets the classloader on the application context and then proceeds as normal.  2.AbstractModuleRegistry should try and load the resource from two possible locations, e.g.   ./modules/source/file/config/file.xml  or  ./modules/source/file.xml  The module registry needs to be a bit smarter to know, ah, i see a config directory, let me try ./config/file.xml otherwise just ./file.xml   *How to verify it works.*  1. JUnit test in which one of the ModuleRegistry implementations points to a test directory that contains both old and new style modules.  FileModuleRegistry is probably a good choice here.  Need to test that the new getting for URL[] works as expected.  2. Existing tests should run as they did before, in particular the shell integration tests.",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-08-20 09:49:11","2013-08-20 08:49:11",5

This caused TapCommandTests to hang due to a Netty worker thread trying to initialize the Lettuce connection (Lettuce uses Netty).

"Spring XD","A batch job can be launched by sending a message on a channel","*Description*  When a job is ‘created’ in SpringXD, a ‘control-channel’ for that job is also created.  The listener for that channel will receive a message, be able to take the ‘jobParameters’ and other launch information from the message, and be able to launch/run the job.  NOTE: I can see a few other stories that should probably be made to break this up after writing it. I put estimate of 10 for now, but we should break this up.  Here are some suggestions  1. create ‘data only’ JobParametersBean equivalent with primitive types 2. create jobLauncher source 3. create jobParameterTransformer processor 4. Refactoring of ChannelRegistry’s aliasHing to use a callback strategy.   *Implementation Suggestions*  job create --name helloWorldJob --definition myjob --somePropertyToOverride=someValue  * This would not execute the batch job immediately, but instead register the job definition and deploys a “jobLauncher” and the job definition to an XD-Container.  * The XD-Container that receives the deploy request message will create a module application context, will also create a channel with the Channel registry named after the job, e.g. :myJob.  This should be a pub/sub channel from the point of view of the middleware.  From the point of view of the spring integration channel, it should ideally be of the executor channel.  There is a limitation in the current implementation of ChannelRegistry now as ‘createInbound’ only creates direct channels.  The boolean ‘aliasHint’ should probably be extended to some type of callback that creates a channel.  The aliasHint was added to address the case of LocalChannelRegistry creating or looking up a queue backed channel or a direct channel. There will be a consumer on the SI channel in the module application context that will be responsible for getting the job launch information and launching the job.  The launching of the job may need to be explicitly done in a separate thread if direct channels are created by the ChannelRegistry.  The contents of the message should be something similar to the current “JobParametersBean”, it needs to be easily serializable with simple types via JSON over the wire.  The current impl of “JobParametersBean” has ObjectMapper, so that may require a bit of reworking.  The handler of the message will use the jobLauncher to launch the job, using the information in the JobParametersBean.  * The ‘myjob’ can then be launched by sending a message, perhaps this is handled by having a jobLauncher source  jobLauncher [--jobParameters <jobParameters>] [--dateFormat <dateFormat>] [--numberFormat <numberFormat>] [--makeUnique <makeUnique>]  > :myJob  e.g. with no-args  jobLauncher  > :myJob  *How to verify it works*  With the test HelloSpringXDTasklet, we should be able to create the job  job create --name helloSpringXD --definition myjob  This will not launch the job (as mentioned in the ‘implementation’ section.  It would then be launched by   jobLauncher  > :myJob  where jobLauncher is a new source.  Ideally would like to be able to test a data driven triggering.  This would require a new file source that doesn’t use the file-to-string-transformer, but lets a File object be the payload.  file | jobParameterTransformer > :myJob ",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-08-19 10:27:10","2013-08-19 09:27:10",16

"Spring XD","JobRepository should be persistent and shared across xd-admin/xd-container","The current code is creating an in-memory job repository for each batch job that is launched.  This makes it impossible to query the tables in the job repository across the cluster.  A single job repository that is backed by a file need to be shared across all jobs that are a launched.  *Implementation Suggestions* * The XDAdmin server should create the job repository schema, if not found, in a HSQLDB database, when it starts up * The bean definitions should be added to the same context that the analytics are being loaded in as it is already shared across xd-admin/xd-container.  The ‘analytics’ context should be renamed to something more generic, ‘shared parent context’ or something. * There is some clean up (removal) of the code in the current JobPlugin, META-INF/spring-xd/plugins/job/common.xml wouldn’t be needed anymore.  That might be all, not sure.  *How to verify it works* * A JUnit test that verifies the spring batch tables were created in the job repository when xd-admin is launched.  This would require deleting the backing db file before instantiating singlenode/xd-admin/xd-container.  * If you start the xd-container it should be able to find the necessary DataSource/JobRepository beans information to be able to contact the database.  We don’t have DI style JUnit tests so this will required getting a reference to the xd-container and it’s application context, and performing ‘getBean(JobRepository.class)’    ",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-08-16 15:58:55","2013-08-16 14:58:55",8

"Spring XD","Refactor Message conversion in ChannelRegistrySupport","After an initial attempt which was not ready for M2 we are rethinking our strategy. One of the fundamental things we have come to realize is that its important to treat serialization and type conversion as separate concerns.  Serialization:  A core principle is the consumer should by default receive exactly what the producer sent:    -   If the producer sends a byte[] payload then no serialization is required.      -   A String payload can use simple byte conversion, taking the Charset into account    -  Transporting an Object uses whatever serialization is configured (json, xml, avro, protocol buffer, java.io, msgpack, etc.).   The actual serialization performed for each message must be shared with the producer and consumer. I.e., the consumer needs to know which case above applies to each payload. Currently we are using the MessageHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE defining custom mime types for this (The designated header is subject to change)  Conversion:     - The consumer optionally defines one or more content-types (read MimeType) it can accept in order of preference. If no conversion succeeds, we can either give them the byte[] payload or throw an exception (configurable?).  Examples:  - Consumer accepts a Java Object (application/x-java-object;type=example.Foo).  Assume for simplicity, the consumer may send a JSON String, or a Foo.  On the receiving end we need to distinguish a String payload containing a JSON representation of Foo from a serialized Foo payload. If the payload is a String, we need to know that its original content is application/json. We are currently using a 2nd original-content-type message header to supply this information.  So in the first case we have (conceptually) content-type: XD plain text , original-content-type application/json.  In the second case we have content-type: XD Serialized JSON original-content-type not used in this case since the serialized JSON includes type information (using Jackson conventions which are a bit brittle).   -If the producer type is different from the accepted type, we use the conversion service and the consumer must register appropriate converters.   A twist for XD that may be generally relevant is that some optimization is possible when we know the bytes represent JSON:  -  Tuple conversion:  Since we serialize using JSON and we know how to transform JSON <->Tuple,  we can convert any Object  payload or any JSON String to a Tuple.  We can avoid the two step deserialization+conversion,  e.g.   1) Foo->JSON->Foo 2) Foo->Tuple. ",Story,Major,Done,"2013-08-15 10:05:31","2013-08-15 09:05:31",10

Currently the only channels used are the .NNN numeric channels where NNN is the index of the module in the stream definition. The source/sink channels are 'extra' channels that need creating - the source channel acting as a real source for the next module in the chain whilst the sink channel acts as a sink output for the last channel in the chain.    I can think of two ways to handle the implementation: - In order to police the stream structure as source | processor* | sink maybe special SourceChannel and SinkChannel modules are created to represent these channels and when deployment happens the deployer understands that they don't represent a real request to deploy a module but simply the channels to wire up to the adjacent module.  - Carry source/sink channel info in the existing module definitions. But then the verification of source/processor*/sink structure will need modification to say a source isn't necessary if the first processor has a source channel attached and a sink isn't necessary if the last processor has a sink channel attached.

Or, via a new plugin handling module undeployments - in the rabbit case, undeploying a consumer would check for us being the last consumer and remove the queue/binding/exchange, since we undeploy left->right, everything can be cleaned up on the consumer side. * Third option would be new methods on the bus {{cleanConsumer}} etc invoked by the {{StreamPlugin}} * Down side of doing it on the admin is that he wouldn't necessarily know which rabbit cluster a stream was deployed to - so it probably has to happen on the container - even so, we'd need the admin url(s) for the cluster.",Story,Minor,Done,"2013-07-09 11:42:15","2013-07-09 10:42:15",5

The thing is, there are several ways to create/override macros (and templates they render to), some of which make sense to our setup: - having asciidoc.conf in the directory of the processed document (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X27) - having docbook.conf/html.conf in the directory of the processed document (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#X27) - defining macros using attributes (http://asciidoc.org/userguide.html#_setting_configuration_entries)  I tried all of those, but to no avail.

"Spring XD","Rename Tuple class in spring-xd-tuple","The Tuple classes in Reactor follow the more traditional data structure concept of Tuples, an immutable fixed length sequence of values where each value can have different types.

There is also a different tuple class instance for each length, e.g. Tuple<T1,T2>, Tuple<T1,T2,T3>.  The Tuple class in XD is more like a record or named tuple.   Python has a named tuple concept - http://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.namedtuple  and http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1490413/languages-that-allow-named-tuples shows that other languages use the term 'Record' for a 'named tuple' - Haskell, Standard ML, OCaml, and F#.  http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/F_Sharp_Programming/Tuples_and_Records#Defining_Records  So boiling it all down, to avoid conflicts of names, and also to open up the possibility of using Reactor tuples as keys (instead of strings for names), we should change the name to either NamedTuple or Record.
