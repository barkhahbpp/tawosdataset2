Steps to reproduce:  # Go to a JIRA version for the project we want to release, go to the release tab, and click to release this JIRA version using the bamboo release plugin  # select release with new build and choose the correct bamboo plan (the release plan with the custom variables)  # Click the link to type a value for the variable thisVersion and enter a value of 1.1.0  # Click the link to type a value for the variable nextVersion and enter a value of 1.2.0.M1-SNAPSHOT  # Click Release  \\  The plan will fire.  If the plan fails, then it is displayed as failing in JIRA and there is a button to retry  \\  # Click Retry and the same release plugin popup will be displayed with the previously selected values already filled out except for these problems:    * *while there are two rows for each of the two plan variables we previously input, the variable name in the dropdown is the same for each*.  It lists both variable names as nextVersion, even though we originally selected the drop downs as thisVersion for the first, and nextVersion for the second.  ** Note that the correct values, however, are still present in the text boxes.  Thus when you see the screen (and I forgot to get a screenshot) you see in the first row a select box with nextVersion but with a value of 1.1.0.  And the second row has (again) nextVersion in the drop down and the text box value of 1.2.0.M1-SNAPSHOT.  Thus, it persisted the text box values correctly but not the drop down selections correctly.  * If you only change the value of the first drop down -- i.e. change the first drop down from nextVersion to thisVersion (which is how we originally filled it out) and don't touch the second drop down box at all -- then it will _only_ set the thisVersion plan variable (the drop down that we physically clicked and changed).  It will _not_ submit the nextVersion variable value to the plan, despite appearing exactly as it did when we originally filled out the form.    This of course made my plan fail a second time as the maven-release plugin needs the nextVersion value, and since I don't have a default maven fails because the next version is  (empty string).    I went back to the Jira Version -> release page and retried a third time.  Again I was presented with a form that had both drop downs displayed as nextVersion.  I clicked the first row drop down and changed it to to the correct thisVersion variable.  Then I clicked the second row (currently nextVersion), deliberately changed it to thisVersion and then clicked again to change it back to nextVersion.  I left the text box values alone -- as they were already correct.    I submitted this and it worked perfectly.    Thus, by clicking the second row dropdown and changing it and changing it back is a valid workaround.  This seems pretty minor as there is an easy workaround and it seems to only be a problem whenever a release build fails, which is probably rare.",Bug,Low,Closed,"2011-09-01 23:15:55","2011-09-01 22:15:55",2
"Atlassian Bamboo ","Handle empty destination directories correctly for artifacts when using Oracle","Currently, the Destination directory option in Artifact Dependency can be left as empty.    This does not work when using Oracle.    Producing artifacts works well, but when a job from a later stage tries to use the artifacts and error occurs.    As Oracle cannot handle storing empty strings, the directory is stored as NULL instead.    It looks like Bamboo fails to deal with NULLs for a destination directory when retrieving and using the value:        The problem happens during execution of the second stage, even though no actual build action is being performed.

"Atlassian Bamboo ","Remove pre-2.0 upgrade tasks and provide protection against upgrade from pre 2.0 version","Krystian:  In the history of Bamboo we had several versions which were required to be used to upgrade to the newer version. Ie. to upgrade from Bamboo 1.0 to Bamboo 2.1 you need to execute upgrades to 1.1.2, 1.2 and 2.0.  The latest of this milestone-upgrade versions is 2.0. This is why I propose to drop all the upgrade tasks which were introduced by pre-2.0 versions. The main benefit would be dropping the last usages of old and usually deprecated APIs  According to https://extranet.atlassian.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=636158922 it means all pre 801 upgrade tasks (18 of them)    Przemek:  + make it impossible to use new Bamboo version to upgrade from build number of pre-2.0.x version.  That check should have been included in 2.0.x anyway...    Marek:  +1, those upgrade tasks are in sources too long. For historical stuff we got subversion    Anton:  Yes, if we do this, Bamboo *must* lockup upon starting if it detects that it is being brought up against a version which is before 2.0.  We should also stop the user importing XML backups from pre 2.0 versions.  In all these cases the user should be given a very clear error message and no data should be changed.  Can I ask why do you bring this up now? What caused you to do this? If we do this, will this simplify some other work we need to do for 3.0?  How long will the work of stopping a pre 2.0 upgrade/import take?    Krystian:  Adding protection against upgrade/import from pre-2.0 version is rather simple and would require ~4h of work (including testing).  I'm bringing this now cause last week Przemek has spotted a small bug which was caused by internal use of deprecated API (BuildManager). I thought that releasing 3.0 is a good moment to drop this (and maybe other) legacy APIs which were deprecated in 2.7 and previous versions.  A lot of uses of deprecated API is buried in old upgrade tasks which led to idea I presented in my original email.  This will probably not simplify other work for 3.0 but has a potential to help us find forgotten usages of legacy code that should have been updated some time ago.",Suggestion,,Closed,"2010-12-14 10:05:51","2010-12-14 10:05:51",1

This which never works, since valid job keys are not valid build keys - effectively disabling the BuildCompleted plugins.

"Atlassian Bamboo ","Allow Import With Maven for Restricted Administrators","We differentiate between System Administrators and Administrators in Studio. System Administrators are Atlassian and Contegix, Administrators may be customers. I was told that these groups roughly map to the notion of Administrators (Studio: System Administrators) and Restricted Administrators (Studio: Administrators) in Bamboo.     The customer is allowed to perform certain administration tasks in Studio's Bamboo, amongst them f.e. to configure the build expiry (BuildExpiryAction). These actions define no interceptor ref and thus use the defaultStack (default-interceptor-ref, xwork.xml). The defaultStack contains as far as I can see only one interceptor for authorisation, that is the permissionCheck (com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.WebworkSecurityInterceptorProxy) interceptor which delegates to an extension of Acegi's org.acegisecurity.intercept.AbstractSecurityInterceptor, com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.intercept.web.WebworkSecurityInterceptor. The AbstractSecurityInterceptor is configured to check, amongst other things,  if principals trying to access   com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.GlobalAdminSecurityAware instances possess one of these authorities: WW_ADMIN,WW_RESTRICTED_ADMIN,GLOBAL_READ (applicationContextAcegiSecurity.xml). The  administrative actions currently configured in Studio to be accessible by Restricted Administrators (Studio: Administrators) implement this interface and thus they are allowed to access the action.    My current task is to allow customers to create build plans from POMs (https://studio.atlassian.com/browse/JST-2328). This action, importMavenPlan (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.actions.admin.ImportMavenPlanCheckoutPomAction) uses a different interceptor stack, buildConfig and globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate. Regarding permissions, as far as I can see, the WebworkSecurityInterceptor is still used due to globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate → basicAdminStackPreValidate →  permissionCheck, but the principal is only checked against these authorities: WW_READ,GLOBAL_READ due to the instance being only a com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.aware.permissions.GlobalReadSecurityAware (BambooActionSupport, see screenshot). The Restricted Administrators pass this test. However, a second permission check is applied in this configuration, the globalAdminStackAlwaysValidate → basicAdminStackPreValidate → globalAdmin (com.atlassian.bamboo.ww2.interceptors.GlobalAdminInterceptor). This interceptor uses the com.atlassian.bamboo.security.acegi.acls.HibernateMutableAclServiceImpl in order to check if the principal has the ADMINISTRATION permission, which he has not (RESTRICTEDADMINISTRATION instead).    My request is to change the configuration for the importMavenPlan action in order to allow it to be used by Restricted Administrators. One way would be to use the default stack and implement GlobalAdminSecurityAware. I haven't checked what other implications that would have regarding the interceptor configuration.

Tail the bamboo log file    The Bamboo logs show this stack trace when JavaMelody is installed in Bamboo 2.6.1:    2010-07-16 14:40:46,712 ERROR [796347291@qtp-745957924-0] [DefaultServletModuleManager] Unable to create filter  com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.util.LazyLoadedReference$InitializationException: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getContextPath()Ljava/lang/String;          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.util.LazyLoadedReference.get(LazyLoadedReference.java:94)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.DefaultServletModuleManager.getFilter(DefaultServletModuleManager.java:321)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.DefaultServletModuleManager.getFilters(DefaultServletModuleManager.java:188)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.filter.ServletFilterModuleContainerFilter.doFilter(ServletFilterModuleContainerFilter.java:53)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.filter.ServletFilterModuleContainerFilter.doFilter(ServletFilterModuleContainerFilter.java:41)          at org.mortbay.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler$CachedChain.doFilter(ServletHandler.java:1139)          at org.springframework.web.filter.CharacterEncodingFilter.doFilterInternal(CharacterEncodingFilter.java:96)          at org.springframework.web.filter.OncePerRequestFilter.doFilter(OncePerRequestFilter.java:75)          at org.mortbay.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler$CachedChain.doFilter(ServletHandler.java:1139)          at org.mortbay.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler.handle(ServletHandler.java:378)          at org.mortbay.jetty.security.SecurityHandler.handle(SecurityHandler.java:216)          at org.mortbay.jetty.servlet.SessionHandler.handle(SessionHandler.java:181)          at org.mortbay.jetty.handler.ContextHandler.handle(ContextHandler.java:765)          at org.mortbay.jetty.webapp.WebAppContext.handle(WebAppContext.java:417)          at org.mortbay.jetty.handler.HandlerWrapper.handle(HandlerWrapper.java:152)          at org.mortbay.jetty.Server.handle(Server.java:324)          at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpConnection.handleRequest(HttpConnection.java:535)          at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpConnection$RequestHandler.headerComplete(HttpConnection.java:865)          at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseNext(HttpParser.java:539)          at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpParser.parseAvailable(HttpParser.java:212)          at org.mortbay.jetty.HttpConnection.handle(HttpConnection.java:404)          at org.mortbay.jetty.bio.SocketConnector$Connection.run(SocketConnector.java:228)          at org.mortbay.thread.QueuedThreadPool$PoolThread.run(QueuedThreadPool.java:520)  Caused by: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getContextPath()Ljava/lang/String;          at net.bull.javamelody.Parameters.getContextPath(Parameters.java:328)          at net.bull.javamelody.MonitoringFilter.init(MonitoringFilter.java:94)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.filter.DelegatingPluginFilter.init(DelegatingPluginFilter.java:43)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.DefaultServletModuleManager$LazyLoadedFilterReference.create(DefaultServletModuleManager.java:371)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.DefaultServletModuleManager$LazyLoadedFilterReference.create(DefaultServletModuleManager.java:356)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.util.LazyLoadedReference$1.call(LazyLoadedReference.java:62)          at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask$Sync.innerRun(Unknown Source)          at java.util.concurrent.FutureTask.run(Unknown Source)          at com.atlassian.plugin.servlet.util.LazyLoadedReference.get(LazyLoadedReference.java:74)    My analysis:  This ServletContext.getContextPath() method is called by the javamelody plugin only if the servlet api version is 2.5 or more.  So the fact that the method is called in Bamboo v2.6.1 Build 1902 / jetty v6.1.15 implies that ServletContext.getMajorVersion() has returned 2 and that ServletContext.getMinorVersion() has returned 5.  But the method call in the plugin throws java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: javax.servlet.ServletContext.getContextPath()Ljava/lang/String;,  even if this method is supposed to exists in the servlet api 2.5.    This issue implies that in this setup (in a plugin with bamboo 2.6.1 Build 1902 and jetty v6.1.15), the servlet api 2.5 was broken somehow: the method must exists.  This is probably related to the fact that there are both servlet-api-2.4.jar and servlet-api-2.5.jar in Bamboo/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/.    Workaround:  The following workaround was tested with success:  1. stop the bamboo server  2. backup and delete the file Bamboo/webapp/WEB-INF/lib/servlet-api-2.4.jar from your bamboo setup (but keep the servlet-api-2.5.jar)  3. restart the bamboo server  4. install the javamelody plugin    Thanks anyway for a great plugin architecture.    PS: The JavaMelody plugin goal is to monitor JIRA, Confluence and Bamboo servers.  ",Bug,Medium,Closed,"2010-08-18 22:52:25","2010-08-18 21:52:25",1

Set with a blocking strategy of Block build if parent plans have unbuilt changes - but I don't think this affects the issue.    Because of the graph of dependencies, and the current methodology of triggering builds in bamboo, the components at the end of the dependency tree can get build multiple times for the same root reason/submission.    Consider the builds:  || Build || Parent Plans ||  | parent | |  | child-A | parent |  | grandchild-B | parent \\  child-A |    If a change is submitted to parent source, then on a successful build, both child-A and grandchild-B builds are queued.

"Atlassian Bamboo ","Persist some calculated data for ArtifactLink","From: https://atlaseye.atlassian.com/cru/CR-BAM-997#c17472    Chai:  Is there any reason why we wouldn't simply store the calculated values? One of the things was that size was not calculated for directories in fear that it was going to be too expensive (which it can be if artifacts are big). Thoughts?    Krystian:  If we decide to persist the url then we shall remember to update it once the buildKey will get changed (build move) which in my opinion adds complexity. We can however store a path with some kind of token to be replaced by planKey while property is being read (/browse/%s/artifacts/build-123/whatever)  If you want to persist artifact size as well, then we might calculate directory size (as it would be done once).    Chai:  Yeah for URL we could just store the calculated suffix (ie the thing that requires us to browse for an index.html etc) and leave out the prefix (that can just be apended, it's not expensive)  + we should store the full size for the directory, though it'd be good to do some testing to see if how much more time it adds (say for a Clover report over JIRA is a good test)",Suggestion,,Closed,"2010-02-19 22:28:20","2010-02-19 22:28:20",2

"Atlassian Bamboo ","Cannot undo Maven POM dependency management","We have 200+ Maven plans configured on one Bamboo instance and some of them are nightly plans with a once-a-day trigger.     On upgrading to 2.5 I set all plans to use the Maven2 dependency management. The problem is that I don't want regular CI plans to trigger nightly plans(as they are resource intensive). When I remove POM dependency management from the nightly builds, it doesn't stop them from being triggered by regular CI plans. I have no choice now but to take the Maven 2 <USER>management off all plans.    Oh well, it was nice while it lasted.     So - any way to stop the Maven 2 dependencies from crossing from plans of one build strategy (polling) to plans of another (single daily build)?",Bug,Low,Closed,"2010-01-22 16:34:11","2010-01-22 16:34:11",3

For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests      containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header      field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a      request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,      the server SHOULD respond with 400 (bad request) if it cannot      determine the length of the message, or with 411 (length required) if      it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.    And below in section 10.4.12:        10.4.12 411 Length Required        The server refuses to accept the request without a defined Content-      Length. The client MAY repeat the request if it adds a valid      Content-Length header field containing the length of the message-body      in the request message.    And further below in section :        14.13 Content-Length        The Content-Length entity-header field indicates the size of the      entity-body, in decimal number of OCTETs, sent to the recipient or,      in the case of the HEAD method, the size of the entity-body that      would have been sent had the request been a GET.        Content-Length = Content-Length : 1*DIGIT        An example is        Content-Length: 3495        Applications SHOULD use this field to indicate the transfer-length of      the message-body, unless this is prohibited by the rules in section      4.4.        Any Content-Length greater than or equal to zero is a valid value.      Section 4.4 describes how to determine the length of a message-body      if a Content-Length is not given.        Note that the meaning of this field is significantly different from      the corresponding definition in MIME, where it is an optional field      used within the message/external-body content-type. In HTTP, it      SHOULD be sent whenever the message's length can be determined prior      to being transferred, unless this is prohibited by the rules in      section 4.4.    According to my research, both Microsoft IIS and Lighttpd are strict on this. I have confirmed that Lighttpd does not have a configuration option to disable this level of strictness. Apache, however, is lax about enforcing this rule. As a result, Apache works and Lighttpd fails.    Please correct the Bamboo Agent upload of artifacts to specify a Content-Length according to the specification defined above so we can switch back to Lighttpd.",Bug,Low,Closed,"2010-01-11 01:35:09","2010-01-11 01:35:09",2

"Atlassian Bamboo ","Upgrade default AMI OS to newer version of Fedora Linux - see reduced scope of this issue","For the current default AMI (ami-3c3dda55 in case of 2.2.1) there are many updates pending and it isn't wise to do it on each instance startup - see:        Anyway - Fedora 10 (the current stable) is publicly available since 2008-11-25 (since almost 5 months):  * [http://fedoraproject.org/en/]  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)]  * [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/10/Schedule]  whereas Fedora 8 was released on 2007-10-08 - about 1.5 year ago:  * [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/8/Schedule]  and exactly this one is the installed Fedora version on the default AMI for Bamboo 2.2.1:      What's more - Fedora 11 (current unstable version) - is scheduled to be released as stable on 2009-05-26:  [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/11/Schedule]    Summing up - if my build needs some additional / upgraded libraries which are not present in F8, but are in F10, then on each EC2 instace's start-up I would need to do the upgrade.  This is not wise in terms of EC2 cost reduction, as it just unnecessarily takes CPU time.    I know currently - in B2.2.1 you - can't use other AMIs than the default one (see also BAM-3756 for a request to customize the AMI used).  But if you happen to create another AMI based on this request (and assuming BAM-3756 not being resolved) should I just take next milestone release of Bamboo to use the new AMI which ID would be just hardcoded in the release?

There were two problems:  * Bamboo did bump up build number and this build failed, but nowhere it was really shown. I.e. on dashboard (and via remote API) I still got last build as successful. And although my build number (in above logs) was now greater than 1000, Bamboo claimed on dashboard and via API that the last build is e.g. 500 (which happened to be the last one before these problems started)  * Cleaning working dir or full checkout did not help  * I solved this problem by full clean and using anonymous SVN access or my private account. Only then Bamboo finally showed new build on dashboard (with number > 1000) and its real status.    I suspect the problem may be also somehow connected to our SVN server which could have applied some security policies to avoid DOS attacks from Bamboo (Bamboo every 3 minutes - above 500 hundred times) was trying to checkout from svn the sources without success.
