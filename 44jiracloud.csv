There are a few cases that you should be <USER>of, which are listed below. We recommend reviewing these and advising your users accordingly.  - The old project key can be used in JQL queries — Users won't have to update issue filters that reference the old project key.  If you use Confluence with JIRA, the JIRA issue macros in Confluence will continue to work. Please note, if you don't see the change straight away, allow some time for the cache to refresh.  - You won't be able to create a new project with the old project key. However, you can change the renamed project back to the old project key. If you delete the project, all associated keys will be freed and you'll be able to re-use them.  - Links will work, whether they are inside JIRA or from external sources. However, link aliases will not be updated — For example, if you have a link to an issue 'EXAMPLE-1' in the description of an issue, and you change the project key 'EXAMPLE' to 'DEMO', then the alias 'EXAMPLE-1' will not be updated to 'DEMO-1'. The link will still direct you to DEMO-1 though.  - If you are using a gadget with a global filter, you will need to update the filter after the project is renamed.  - All attachments will be accessible after the project key change. Please note however, that the directory that they are stored in (under the <JIRA Home>\data\attachments directory) will be retain the old project key. For example, if you change a project's key from TEST to DEMO, the attachments will be stored under <JIRA Home>\data\attachments\TEST.  - If you export a renamed project, then import it, it will have the updated project key, i.e. the original project key will not be retained. In fact, all historical keys for that project will be removed. There is a workaround for this that involves changing data directly in your database, see [this Answers post|https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/257060/renaming-and-importing-a-project-where-has-the-old-project-key-history-gone-redirects-search?page=1#257061].  {quote}    {quote}  *Notes for developers*    - REST API calls will still work with old project key — REST calls that specify an issue key will work with the old issue key after the project key has changed. For example, /rest/api/issue/EXAMPLE-100 will still work after the project key is changed from EXAMPLE to DEMO.  - We have created a new event, ProjectUpdatedEvent. This event is triggered any time a project's details are changed, including changing the project key.  - If you need to retrieve all issue keys and project keys (historical and current), you can do this via the following:  -* REST:  Get all project keys for a project: /rest/api/2/project/<project key>?expand=projectKeys  -* Java API:  -*- Get all project keys: com.atlassian.<USER>project.ProjectManager#getAllProjectKeys  -*- Get all issue keys for an issue: com.atlassian.<USER>issue.IssueManager#getAllIssueKeys  {quote}",Bug,Low,Closed,"2017-11-02 11:54:32","2017-11-02 11:54:32",4

Using *JIRA Server*? [See the corresponding suggestion|http://<USER>atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-60326].  {panel}  h3. Problem Definition    Currently JIRA has a new REST API call for user properties.

The new user properties in the REST API are intended to be used by remote integrations and add-ons to store per-user data and settings. This helps add-ons provide a customized experience for each JIRA user while keeping all the data in the JIRA Cloud instance's database. These properties are generally intended to be used by add-ons. We do not plan to build a UI to create and set properties – you are more than welcome to use them, but to retrieve user properties using a GET request on /rest/api/2/user/properties, they must be set with a PUT to /rest/api/2/user/properties/\{propertyKey}.    We absolutely recognize the confusion that having two different sets of user properties can cause, and we intend to rectify this in the future.  {quote}   # JRACLOUD-59760:  {quote}There is a [free add-on for JIRA Cloud|https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.connect.entity-property-tool.prod/cloud/overview] that provides the ability to edit user entity properties, which are [accessible via the user entity properties REST API discussed on this issue|https://docs.atlassian.com/<USER>REST/cloud/#api/2/user/properties].     We know that one of the most common use cases for user properties is workflow automation.

Please revise the documentaiton to address the following four issues, numbered A, B, C & D:  A) When importing JIRA Agile projects from one JIRA Software 7.0 system to another, the user is in a Catch-22 situation regarding workflows.  The Project Import documentation states:  {color:#14892c}If you wish to retain a customized workflow from your backup, you will need to create a new workflow in your target JIRA instance and manually edit the new workflow (e.g. create steps and transitions) to reflect your old workflow  . . . Do not use the JIRA functionality for exporting and importing workflow XML definitions, to copy your backup workflow to your target JIRA instance. {color}  However, when it comes to Aglie projects, the workflow itself contains comments which contradict the above documentation:  {color:#654982}This workflow is managed internally by JIRA Agile. Do not manually modify this workflow{color}  Please provide clarification what to do specifically regarding workflows when importing Agile-style projects:  1) Should the workflow be recreated manually? 2) Should the workflow be exported as XML, then imported on the target system and manually revised? 3) Or is it best to use the workflow that is created when the empty project is first created on the target system?  B) When creating the new empty projects on the target system, is it OK to create a non-Agile project, then later associate the project with an Agile workflow?  Or must the new empty projects be created as Agile projects from the start (via an Agile-enabled project template)?  C) I often assign the same workflow to multiple non-Aglie projects.  Is it possible for Agile projects to have shared workflows?  Or must each Agile project have a distinct workflow?  D) Please provide some sample SQL queries that could be used to re-establish Boards and other Agile data that the JIRA Software 7.0 Import Tool currently skips.  So far, the best procedure I have found is at [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/18448856/how-to-import-<USER>agile-sprint-data-project-by-project], but there is no way for me to know whether these steps are correct and complete.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://<USER>atlassian.com/browse/JRASERVER-59424].   {panel}  As per costumer feedback: {quote} It may be better to exclude the whole /<USER>home/caches/ directory all together, as it looks like this is just temporary content as well as the indexes. There is also the tmp folder, which looks to be the same kind of thing. I'd guess those two locations are the most likely to be modified during a copy.  I've tried copying the HOME folder without either of those two directories (using exclude commands in rsync) and Jira actually starts up fine without them. It re-creates them when it first runs and starts to fill them with content again. The index page says that the index is missing and that it should be restored and re-built; re-creating it only took 6 minutes or our test system.  I think it would be very good to update the documentation in light of all this. Right now, it says create a snapshot of the data directory (including all files and subdirectories), then back up the snapshot:  https://confluence.atlassian.com/<USER>backing-up-data-185729581.html  I think it would be better and clearer to say:  The recommended method of backing up the data directory is to copy it to another location while excluding both the /<USER>data/caches/ and /<USER>data/tmp folders, and then to archive the copied folder (using <USER> tar.gz, etc). This is because the content in those two folders is frequently modified, which may cause the copy to fail, and because Jira will simply re-create these folders and their content if they are missing.  NOTE: the Jira index is stored inside the caches directory, so will be lost using this method. You can enable restorable index in the system options to create backups of the index, which you can then restore later. Alternatively, if time is available, you can re-create the index from scratch after you have restored Jira.  Here is an example rsync command for the copy:  rsync -avh --delete --exclude 'caches' --exclude 'tmp' --stats --progress /<USER>data/ /<USER>rsync/    That would definately have helped me when I was configuring the backup. {quote}",Suggestion,,Closed,"2016-01-18 09:00:49","2016-01-18 09:00:49",4

Which is not true. The group is swapped only for comments and worklogs. Someone decided that visibility restrictions stands only for these two entities. However you do restrict visibility of an issue by setting its security level, don't you?  Probably we can't change behaviour of the resource (it's part of API) and underlying GroupService, but we can at least document it better, as is the GroupService#deleteGroup documented, so it's clear what will get swapped.  We'd also consider retiring GroupService#deleteGroup and DELETE /group?swapGroup behaviour in favour of swapping groups in comments and worklogs but also all schemes, which will make it consistent with RoleService and DELETE /role implementation, which (will) swap role in comments, worklogs, and schemes.
