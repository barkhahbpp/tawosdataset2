"The MongoDB Engineering","Try using gRPC with mac hosts again","A few months ago, I tested communicating with the Mac hosts using gRPC instead of SSH because SSH is fragile and highly dependent on the SSH command producing well-formed output. I'm pretty sure I also filed a ticket to allow the app servers to reach out to Jasper on the Mac hosts over gRPC, but it didn't work even after the ticket was closed.

"The MongoDB Engineering","Handle custom builds when downloading binaries on hosts from S3","Staging will not download binaries from S3, but production will (to reduce load on the server during deploys). In order for production to download from S3, the binaries must have been uploaded to the desired location in S3 or else binary downloads will fail. Because custom builds may or may not have uploaded the binaries to the S3 location, we have to come up with a way to do one of the following:   # Disable downloading binaries from S3 (so that it downloads from the app server). I'm assuming that people will _not_ remember  (or know) to disable the admin setting flag for downloading from S3 (EVG-13258) when deploying a custom build to production.   # Guarantee that the binaries are uploaded in the correct location in S3.    There's several options to deal with this, with some options such as:   * Add a large warning text when someone deploys a custom build to production (easy, but you still have to see the text in the output).   * As a pre-deploy step, require that the binaries in dist.tar.gz be uploaded to S3 before deploying the custom build. This would slow down custom build deploys, but would allow the binaries to be downloaded from S3 and would not require any database changes (slowest option, but would require no code changes to deal with it in the application code).   * When deploying a custom build, disable the database feature flag for using S3 URLs vs. app server URLs to download binaries.   * Modify host provisioning to try downloading the binary from S3 first, and download from the app server as a fallback. If it fails to download from S3 (due to 403/404), fall back to downloading it from the app server. This could be a bit wasteful in provisioning time, but assuming custom build deploys are uncommon, it might not be that bad in terms of performance.",Task,"Major - P3",Open,"2020-10-19 23:18:56","2020-10-19 23:18:56",2

This change addresses the most severe performance issues noted in EVG-12710. Additionally, it allows users to more clearly identify and keep track of their patch failures, particularly for patches with large numbers of tasks, since they no longer need to pick out individual red boxes. This patch also includes optimizations to more quickly filter by variant and by status within a variant.     Users can filter by variant by clicking on variant titles (EVG-13111).

It only looks at depends_on. display_only tasks are said to depend_on the tasks that the tasks they generate depend on, but can start well before these tasks. This leads to instances, such as mongodb_mongo_master_fbafa599da8f316e508d0a152586a77e85805c29 , where the slowdown is less than zero. Additionally, The topological ordering of the task DAG implicitly treats generated tasks as equivalent in start time to tasks scheduled at the very beginning. This could lead to an underestimate, rather than overestimate, of idealized runtime. I think the following approach will correct this:    Remove dependencies of display_only tasks.    Create a dummy generator node, whose end time is equivalent to the time of the generated task's creation, whose start time is equivalent to the generator task's start time, and which ¿depends on the same tasks as the generator task, if genuine dependencies can be found?  depends on.

My use case is that I am generating a matrix where the axes are Swift language version and operating system.    For one particular combination of Swift version and OS, I do not want a corresponding variant because the language version is not supported on the OS version.    It would be nice to have a remove_variants rule similar to remove_tasks that allows you to specify variants to remove.    Currently, my workaround is to define a separate matrix for the Swift language version in question and list out all the OSes except the problematic one as values for the OS axis. This works, but the duplication is not ideal.    Note that adding a {{remove_tasks: *}} rule with the corresponding OS/language version criteria does not work, because it results in a variant with no tasks, and Evergreen enforces that each variant has at least one task.",Task,"Major - P3",Open,"2020-09-23 20:51:39","2020-09-23 20:51:39",2

The throughput of the operations wasn't calculated in the perf ui, and there are some negative durations.    Looking at the generated .ftdc files, the timestamps are out of order, while the cedar calculation of wallclock duration seems to be using the [first and last element listed|https://github.com/evergreen-ci/cedar/blob/e3c5d337c2c8ff346c09d5db95515ab4657d367c/perf/ftdc_rollups.go#L81]. I think the increase concurrency and buffering may be causing us to send them to poplar in different orders. Grpc only guarantees an ordering to events within a single stream, whereas we have many.    I think a straightforward solution would be to use the min/max timestamps instead of the first and last elements, but I'm not sure if poplar is _supposed_ to be guaranteeing a timestamp order when writing to disk, or if there are any other implications of the elements being out of order to deal with.",Bug,"Major - P3",Closed,"2020-09-23 19:41:53","2020-09-23 19:41:53",4

Given that the time wasted has not exceeded 11%, it seems like switching entirely to on-demand is not a great long-term solution, since this would roughly double costs on 4xlarge instances. Two possible approaches are:    1. Move as many tasks as possible to smaller instance types. 2xlarge have lower termination rates than 4xlarge, and xlarge have virtually zero terminations. (According to the spot price advisor and our AWS rep, switching regions or instance types, like c5 to m5, will not help.)  2. -Switch to on-demand when spot instances are less available. It's possible we could do this in cases where Evergreen receives InsufficientInstanceCapacity errors.- Edit: This is done.

A display task with blocked execution tasks is auto-restarted. Prior to the restart, some execution tasks failed with system failures and other tasks didn't run at all, being blocked. The display task is restarted and all tasks complete successfully. The confusion is that the tasks that had been blocked would have results from multiple executions, while only having truly executed once.

The schema for this file is the following:      *Machine workflow*    Evergreen should perform the following in order to execute this command:  1. Validate the schema of the reported data. Fail the command if the data is not formatted correctly.  2. Create a new document with metadata from evergreen:      3. Store this in the same place as json.send, under the performance-data key/name. This should make this data available through the json history routes for our performance monitoring service to consume. Fail the command if unable to store the data.    4. Notify signal processing service of the update:      The credentials for making requests to SPS are already provided in Cedar. *DO NOT FAIL THE COMMAND IF THIS CALL FAILS*. This should generate a warning perhaps, but our service will consider the data for this run on the subsequent run. As long as evergreen has stored the data, we are good.

"The MongoDB Engineering","Allow projects to predefine applicable spawnhost setup scripts for hosts spawned from task data","Spawning hosts with downloaded task (failure) artifacts has proven incredibly useful. However, extracting the right contents for inspection can be complex due to multiple reasons including:  * Evergreen configuration is a complexity that is (by necessity) abstracted away in some degree to the majority of programmers on a project.  * Projects themselves being complex and having custom scripts/tools for inspecting output to abstract away (to some degree) internal complexities for the large majority of programmers (also necessary).    The recent completion of EVG-5856 gives a predictable place for users to input/execute these scripts. The request in this ticket is to better utilize that box with a set of predefined (in configuration...somewhere) project options in an effort to make these scripts trivially discoverable for newcomers..    For example, server engineers are often spawning hosts from task failures with core dumps to inspect their contents. However finding the core dumps and properly setting up gdb are still mostly trial and error for the uninitiated.

Considerations:  - logging might impact the throughput of the event collector, which means we probably need to make it a wrapper to a collector. (This would probably be simplified by adding a Count() method to the Collector interface)   - users may want to opt-in to this kind of reporting, which would require changes to the poplar registry and its interfaces.  - for many tests, there are multiple collectors running in parallel, which means the logging messages produced should probably have an ID of some sort, again this might require adding a Name() method to the Collector interface, and providing a way for the to propagate through the interfaces.     I suspect for clarity and stability, we will want to implement message.Composer (from grip) with a type that produces a well-formed message and optional . message.Fields may not have an easy to scan format.

In my case job is still running. As far I see, AbortableRunner doesn't call `Queue.Complete()`         And workaround not easy because implementation of `Queue.Complete()` in case of `priorityLocalQueue` is not reliable — counter is simply decrementing, so, anyone can easily break stats if call  `Queue.Complete` several times.

These are common points of confusion for users, so we should provide a quick fix to mitigate the confusion until we arrive at a long-term solution in EVG-13201.    Per a discussion with DAG, it's not feasible to only surface execution tasks to users, since DAG tooling relies heavily on display tasks. A potential short-term solution is to show display tasks in Spruce similarly to how they are shown in the [legacy UI|https://evergreen.mongodb.com/task/mongodb_mongo_v4.4_enterprise_rhel_62_64_bit_inmem_required_display_burn_in_tests_patch_29e21d0ff597e6dd10bbb9bab4086612339443ca_5f43f081d6d80a3602a3c14f_20_08_24_16_53_31##comparehashes=29e21d0ff597e6dd10bbb9bab4086612339443ca&threads=maxonly]. Since we cannot safely exclusively show execution tasks in the UI, and there is enough user confusion about accessing both display tasks and execution tasks separately, re-adding the layer of indirection between them is the best short-term solution until EVG-13201.    In light of issues like EVG-12591, Spruce should not allow restarting of individual execution tasks in this short term solution. Additionally, there should be links between execution tasks and their corresponding display task, similar to the 'Parent display task' link in the [legacy UI|https://evergreen.mongodb.com/task/mongodb_mongo_v4.4_enterprise_rhel_62_64_bit_inmem_required_burn_in:logical_session_cache_sharding_100ms_refresh_jscore_txns_passthrough_0_enterprise_rhel_62_64_bit_inmem_required_patch_29e21d0ff597e6dd10bbb9bab4086612339443ca_5f43f081d6d80a3602a3c14f_20_08_24_16_53_31/0##comparehashes=29e21d0ff597e6dd10bbb9bab4086612339443ca&threads=maxonly].",Bug,"Major - P3","Needs Design","2020-06-16 18:45:06","2020-06-16 18:45:06",2

"The MongoDB Engineering","Track duration of time between patch build creation and patch build scheduling","I am interested to track a metric that gives a sense of how long it takes a user to configure a patch build, whether via the evergreen UI or relying exclusively on the CLI. This metric, along with data on how many users are using the UI, and whether users are running builds with all required tasks of all required builds vs. builds with some curated selection of tasks, would be interesting to look at to gauge usability of the patch build configuration process.    I believe we already can get a sense of how many users are using the UI to configure patch builds by looking at the POST requests to the patch build configuration page.

"The MongoDB Engineering","Allow passing a YAML document to host.create","As part of PM-1822, the STM team would like to dramatically simplify the process for authoring and running performance workloads. A significant part of the work involves simplifying how the infrastructure is provisioned. The status quo has been to use {{terraform}}, which can be configured through YAML files. See [example config here|https://github.com/10gen/dsi/blob/master/configurations/infrastructure_provisioning/infrastructure_provisioning.M60-like-replica.yml]. There are a few pain points with this approach    1. users need to go through mana to add their ssh credentials and configure DSI to use them  2. we're limited to a single az without a significant refactor  3. we can't enforce the life cycle of the spawned hosts without outside help (e.g. ec2-reaper)  4. terraform doesn't always successfully teardown all components in the cluster, e.g. security groups.    These are all problems that Evergreen has solved. So it makes sense logically for Evergreen to handle the topology of performance tasks. In fact, {{host.create}} already does this.    The one caveat is that terraform allows topologies to be created locally in an identical manner to an Evergreen task, which {{host.create}} currently cannot do. For adding performance tests and triaging problems, it's a common use case to run a portion of a test, tweak some knobs, then rerun the test, which is hard to do in a patch build and is similar to what spawn hosts are frequently used for.    For performance tests, we need to be able to spin up hosts with a particular distro, az, network interface options (which is usually the default), and optionally the EC2 region.

There is actually another commit in between, 7a4ea, which fixed the compilation failure:        However, the this commit does not appear anywhere in the evergreen UI. This is either a UI bug, or EVG never noticed the commit at all. Either way, not being able to see the revert commit in the history drawer made diagnosing this BF very confusing.

Since it's not a url that we generated and uploaded to s3, we cannot sign it.     Even if the link they are provided IS an s3 link, we still can't sign it, unless we expand the params to also take in the aws key and secret that they used to upload the file with.

Alternatively, we could create a new notification type called first failing task in patch, and users could subscribe to one or both of patch finish and first failing task in patch.     Original text from [~<USER>:    My understanding is currently PR patch builds are not treated differently from other patch builds, in the sense of deferring the determination of pass or failed upon completion of all tasks in the patch build.    Ideally, any task failure in a PR patch build will immediately mark the failure of the PR testing (without waiting for other tasks to complete), and cancel all other running tasks (to save build resource).

(I get the task above with the API call: /v2/builds/{}/tasks)    I clearly see that the cases in which stat_check_init doesn't create the fourth task are cases where it finishes its run BEFORE the other tasks get their schedule time (according to the event logs)",Bug,"Major - P3",Closed,"2019-10-04 20:10:50","2019-10-04 20:10:50",1

In the GitHub-backed commit queue, supporting arbitrary commit messages is trivial, because we are relying on GitHub's own mechanisms for merging, and GitHub has access to the actual prospective commits.    In the CLI commit queue, however, the current implementation does not have access to the actual commits. We explored using {{git am}} and initially rejected it as an option, since using it does not work with the way Evergreen renders diffs. (There may have been another reason, which I do not remember.)    However, [~<USER> pointed out 2 problems with our current approach  1. Developers are used to squashing their own commits. The current model of shipping a diff of the entire set of commits means that users can no longer push a set of commits at once.  2. The commit queue does not support multi-line commit messages. It is also awkward that a user writes a commit message and then must rewrite that message on the command line.

"The MongoDB Engineering","Restarting failed generate.tasks should re-run generate.tasks","Currently, generate.tasks will only execute a single time, since only a single job with a task's ID can exist in the database. If a generate.tasks job has failed to be _put_, then restarting a task containing generate.tasks will put that job, and the job will execute. This allows people to restart a task that, for example, went system-unresponsive before getting to the {{generate.tasks}} step.    However, if the job has already run, and has failed, then restarting the generate.tasks task will not cause the job to retry. In this server version https://evergreen.mongodb.com/version/mongodb_mongo_master_6b4bf643ce6a68c3c0c0d17075b3ef264ecb243d, for example, restarting the purple tasks will not cause the generate.tasks step to retry.

"The MongoDB Engineering","Database queueing when hosts become idle","When we increased maxhosts from 500 to 1000, we observed that read tickets dropped to 0 a couple times a day. I believe this is because there were only undispatchable task group tasks present in the queue, so the idle hosts were causing lots of queries that validated that task group tasks should not be run. This will be fixed in the new scheduler, but we turned that on for a single distro today. Since we may discover bugs in the new scheduler and need to revert back to the legacy scheduler, we should put in some improvements to reduce database load when hosts are idle for the legacy scheduler. These should include  1. Persist the entire queue. If the queue is long, and the head of the queue contains only undispatchable task group tasks, there may be dispatchable tasks at the tail.  2. Agents should back off getting the next task. Currently they only jitter, with a 10-second interval.  3. Revert the change to increase idle host time for hosts that just ran a task group. I believe they were terminated and didn't run the next task because the entire queue wasn't persisted.","Problem Ticket","Major - P3",Closed,"2019-06-07 22:36:11","2019-06-07 22:36:11",1

"The MongoDB Engineering","Evergreen CLI patch command should not submit uncommitted changes by default","*Motivation*: The Evergreen CLI merge queue command submits only committed changes to Evergreen's merge queue, since we want to reduce the risk of a developer submitting changes to the merge queue that they don't actually wish to commit.    Evergreen GitHub pull request testing has a similar interface. To be included in a pull request, the code must be committed locally.    Evergreen's patch command differs. It includes changes to files tracked by git that have changed in the working directory but have not yet been committed. This has been confusing for users in the past (e.g., EVG-782). It also does not match the merge queue command, which will mean that users of the merge queue via the CLI might submit code reviews that differ from what they ship to the merge queue.    *Solution*: Evergreen's patch command currently supports submitting only committed changes by passing the {{--ref}} flag. This ticket will make that the default.    Many teams outside the server use pull request testing and will therefore be unaffected. However, some teams may rely on the current behavior and may be surprised by the change. To address this, we will   * Warn the user when they are submitting a patch if there uncommitted changes in their working directory.   * Send an email notifying users that we are making this change.   * Add an option to the {{patch}} command that preserves the old behavior.   * Add an option to the .evergreen.yml that will cause the old behavior to be the default    The feature is documented in the Evergreen Wiki: [https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Using-the-Command-Line-Tool#working-tree-changes]",Improvement,"Major - P3",Closed,"2019-05-02 19:27:38","2019-05-02 19:27:38",2

"The MongoDB Engineering","adding 'requires' to a task in a task group","For the mongo server, we have to compile the server before we can run any test tasks. As part of compile, we used to upload debug symbols to S3 for debugging purposes. The debug symbols take about 3 minutes to upload. We separated that upload into its own task and made a Task Group with compile and upload, so that we could start running tests without having to wait the 3 minutes for the debug symbols to upload.     Now, however, there is a problem that a user could select to run a task that has 'compile' as a depends on and then 'upload debug symbols' does not get run. We somehow need to also make sure upload debug symbols get run if compile is run.    One solution would be to add a 'requires' to 'compile' that specified 'upload debug symbols', but since they are both in a task group together, I don't think this is supported.     Another option would be to put them back into the same task and provide a way to trigger dependencies before the task has fully completed (after compile, but before uploading the debug symbols).",Improvement,"Major - P3",Closed,"2019-05-01 20:43:39","2019-05-01 20:43:39",4

So I imagine if the metric name and metric values are parameterized based on the drop down - all you need to do then is have a change to the drop down trigger a charts refresh based on the new selection. Similarly, you can parameterize the metric name in task_perf_data.html to get rid of ops_per_sec and ops_per_sec_values and instead use the metric selected.

Moreover, the nil in that message is confusing because Ruby uses nil, hence I was wondering if this was some kind of a Ruby-triggered cancellation.    Additionally, there is a multitude of timeouts that can be set throughout evergreen configuration. One has to go through the docs to identify the appropriate timeout for each case.    To provide a better developer experience, evergreen should:    1. Clearly state that a task/build/process/etc. was killed due to a timeout.  2. Clearly state which timeout was exceeded.    It was pointed out that the agent log contains the following:        Duplicating this exact message into task logs would be an improvement over the current timeout reporting, as then a user wouldn't need to go through multiple logs to figure out what happened (as well as know whether they should be looking in agent logs, system logs, event logs, task logs or all 4).    https://github.com/evergreen-ci/evergreen/wiki/Project-Files does mention exec_timeout_secs.

Tasks already in the schedule will be dispatched.' that was set for -test. Unchecking it seems to have resolved the problem.    Failing to deploy the agent 10 times results in quarantining the host. If the connection between disabling scheduling tasks and quarantining the hosts in the distro can make some sense in theory, it doesn't seem right that it's intentional because it requires 10 failed agent deploys.

There seems to be a negative consequence to this, which is that for very large logs, editing the current search term becomes quite laggy. That is, trying to quickly type a term or delete a few characters becomes much slower than you would expect from a responsive text input box. Here is one [example log|https://logkeeper.mongodb.org/lobster/build/834158c1a5f92af0f569f178be004413/test/5b809f89c2ab68145a00ea9d#bookmarks=0%2C183196] that exhibits this behavior. It is a bit over 180,000 lines.     Depending on user's preferences, one fix would be to consider _not_ updating the highlighted search terms until a user presses Enter again. Only then would the highlighted search terms update to reflect the current text value in the search bar. Personally, I prefer this behavior since it ensures that the current context is not changed while entering a new search term i.e. if I am focused on one particular log line while entering a new search term, I know that the logs won't be scrolled to a different position until I actually press Enter.

We occasionally see BFG tickets where there's a failure on ARM, zSeries, or PowerPC from a very old commit for an issue that has since been resolved. This confuses both the Build Baron and Server engineers because the expectation is that recent failures which are reported are actually recent. I can't imagine a use-case for wanting an Evergreen task which spends over a week in the task queue to have a guarantee that it actually gets run.    It should, however, still be possible to manually schedule an older commit and have it run if the task can be assigned to a machine quickly enough. This is still an expected workflow to manually try and bisect when a failure was introduced if stepback couldn't.    This behavior has already been implemented in EVG-2343 and EVG-3418 for the case where Evergreen decides itself that a build should be scheduled but doesn't handle the case where a user (e.g. [~<USER>) manually scheduled a whole version.",Improvement,"Major - P3",Closed,"2018-07-10 17:22:07","2018-07-10 17:22:07",4

I believe we should do two things:   # Query Splunk for the logging in describeHourlySpotPriceHistory and getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance to determine if one of these functions represents the bulk of the calls to DescribeSpotPriceHistory. They may both be used heavily, since the former is called each time we spawn a host, and the latter each time a task ends.   # Figure out how to cache these data. (The two cases use different parameters, but I think this is only because getLatestLowestSpotCostForInstance passes a future date to only get the latest price, so we can make the calls identical). It might make sense to cache these data. We can use their granularity to determine our caching strategy, or use 1-minute granularity, since it's unlikely we care to make finer distinctions than that.",Task,"Major - P3",Closed,"2018-05-10 20:06:07","2018-05-10 20:06:07",2

It is expected that this shell script will invoke a script placed on the machine by buildhost-configuration. It is also the responsibility of the caller to noop some of the time, since this hook will run before every task.

"The MongoDB Engineering","write new host allocator ","The current host allocator (duration-based) is too complex (as it accounts for hosts to appear in multiple distros) but we should be able to write a drop-in replacement that allocates hosts based on the expected runtime of tasks, with some adjustments.    We've observed a number of cases where the scheduler *over* allocates hosts and they end up being terminated because the queue is empty by the time they have started.     I think we should make the following adjustments:     - currently evergreen assumes that tasks without past runtimes have runtimes of 10 minutes. I think there are enough tasks in the system that are shorter than 10 minutes, that we should change this assumption to 5m or 2m30s. We could also compute an average runtime for *all* tasks in the system (project?) and just use that.   - we should never allocate *more* than the total number of pending tasks in the queue. (and probably allocate somewhat less.)   - allocate enough hosts to run the tasks in the queue in the specified time. (this is what we mostly do now.    More details to come.

"The MongoDB Engineering","avoid terminating slow hosts that have provisioned","currently we have an absolute cutoff for a host to go from started->running a task, and it leasds to some frustrating cases where we successfully provision hosts that then get killed before the host gets an agent.     We should:   - when flagging slow provisioning hosts for termination we should make sure that they're actually not-yet-provisioned.  - have the timer reset when the host gets provisioned so waiting for agent is tracked separately rather than having a single timeout for everything.    - right now the is this host idle and should be terminated is in 2 files and at 3-4 functions/statements, that should be centralized. It would be great if this could be expressed in a way that could be queried for from mongodb rather than filtered at the application level.   - for better traceability, we should log a reason for flagging a host for termination in the event log or at least in splunk when we terminate it.

The challenge encountered here is - different tasks inherited from the anchored variant need to be run on different sizes of Windows instances (large vs small), so that we need to apply different run_on/distro values after using the tag selectors.     Take below code snippet as example, we need tasks covered by .wtdevelop !.windows-large tag to use small Windows instance, while tasks covered by .wtdevelop .windows-large to use large Windows instance. Please note the run_on and distro settings here was just a test performed in the [patch build|https://evergreen.mongodb.com/filediff/5aaa08b5c9ec44509f19bd71/?file_name=etc%2Fevergreen.yml&patch_number=0], which did not achieve the desired result.

In this case log(1/3) = -log(3/1) and also log(1/1) = 0 (I think it fits the best for charts, for example trend chart)  * or modify existing function, so we could keep percentages: (sign(Sa / Sb) * max(Sa.

In sys-perf, we have quite a few tasks and some of them run for a long time. We would like to add a couple smoke test tasks, like ycsb_short and mongoshell_short, and configure those to always be triggered automatically when one posts a PR.    But, if I know that my patch is in fact related to the initialsync_logkeeper_WT task, then I should be able to go into the patch build page and schedule that task in addition to the automatically scheduled ones. It should also be possible for a reviewer to do so. (Basically, any MongoDB Inc engineer.)    I'm torn on the question whether it should be allowed to unschedule the automatically added ones. A possible answer is that it should be allowed to do so in evergreen, but if a repo is configured to require certain tests to pass, then failing to run said tests would of course block ability to merge the PR.",Improvement,"Major - P3",Closed,"2018-01-29 20:27:50","2018-01-29 20:27:50",2

"The MongoDB Engineering","Let distros use multiple availability zone/subnets in AWS VPC","This came up during our work on the VPC migration project.    Currently, Evergreen allows to spin up instances in VPCs by specifying security group and subnet id in the distro settings and it works perfectly.    Subnet is assigned to 1 availability zone so each distro is limited to just 1 availability zone. But to fully take advantage of spot instances, one should have access to multiple zones and let AWS decide which one to used based on the current spot price.    AWS lets you do that. From the spot request wizard, I can choose one or multiple subnets or the entire vpc. If no subnets are specified, AWS will use the default subnet in the zone it picks for you.    That wizard lets me save the json file for the cli.  Here's the request with multiple subnets:  {code:json}{    IamFleetRole: arn:aws:iam::xxxxxxxxxx:role/aws-ec2-spot-fleet-tagging-role,    AllocationStrategy: lowestPrice,    TargetCapacity: 1,    SpotPrice: 0.21,    ValidFrom: 2017-09-08T19:47:08Z,    ValidUntil: 2018-09-08T19:47:08Z,    TerminateInstancesWithExpiration: true,    LaunchSpecifications: [      {        ImageId: ami-80861296,        InstanceType: c3.xlarge,        SubnetId: subnet-5c8de539, subnet-32c6aa6a,        KeyName: mci,        SpotPrice: 0.21,        BlockDeviceMappings: [          {            DeviceName: /dev/sda1,            Ebs: {              DeleteOnTermination: true,              VolumeType: gp2,              VolumeSize: 8,              SnapshotId: snap-066a4d67938024381            }          }        ],        SecurityGroups: [          {            GroupId: sg-bc0592c6          }        ]      }    ],    Type: request  }  The only difference is SubnetId field - VPC-wide request doesn't have it. There is nothing that explicitly specifies the vpc id though, I think security group id is what maps it to a vpc.    I tried to update a test distro in stage to use multiple subnet ids (like 'subnet-4a710810, subnet-b9bb64dd, subnet-5f173773, subnet-423cc17d') and the UI let me do that, but the runner reported an error - EC2 RunInstances API call returned error: The subnet ID 'subnet-4a710810, subnet-b9bb64dd, subnet-5f173773, subnet-423cc17d' does not exist (InvalidSubnetID.NotFound)    UI doesn't let save the distro with the empty subnet. I tried to update the db directly and runner also got an error - EC2 RunInstances API call returned error: VPC security groups may not be used for a non-VPC launch (InvalidParameterCombination)    We would really like to have the option to either specify multiple subnet ids or not specify any and use the entire VPC because, with VPC migration project, the alternative would be running a script in the background to find the availability zone with the lowest price and update the distro to use the corresponding subnet. But it's ugly and can cause issues if we don't update the distros fast enough.    ","New Feature","Major - P3",Closed,"2017-09-08 22:18:53","2017-09-08 22:18:53",4

"The MongoDB Engineering","build_id and task_id have a race condition for patch builds","Recent discussions and inspection gave me the impression that expansions work roughly this way (where roughly means I'm not trying to be specific about how reserved characters are converted to dashes or underscores or whatever):    * project' – key for project in evergreen  * 'revision' – SHA1 of a commit in the repo for the project  * 'build_variant' – entry in the 'buildvariants' part of the config.yml  * 'task_name' – task name from 'tasks' part of config.yml  * 'version_id'  ** For commits: roughly {{$\{project\}\_$\{revision\}}}  ** For patches: a unique ID  * 'build_id' – roughly {{$\{project\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{revision\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{$\{project\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{task_name\}\_$\{revision\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}}}  * 'execution' – number of times a 'task_id' has executed (starting at 0)    My understanding is that TIMESTAMP is the commit timestamp for commits and the submission time for patches.    From this, it appears that it is possible for two patches on the same commit submitted at the same TIMESTAMP to wind up with the same 'build_id's and 'task_id's.    Without considering backwards compatibility issues, it looks like for patch builds, the 'build_id' and 'task_id' should be using the 'version_id' in place of the 'revision' field.    Alternatively, if 'version_id' for patches were 'project_<UNIQUEID>', then 'build_id' and 'task_id' could remove the 'project' and 'revision' expansions and just use 'version_id' instead, as it would include project information and a unique identifier:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}\_$\{task_name\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}}}    It would be even more consistent, perhaps, to put timestamp after 'version_id' since that's what it's tied to, which would give you:    * 'build_id' – roughly {{$\{version_id\}\_$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{build_variant\}}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}}}    TIMESTAMP could even go first, before 'version_id', which has the added value of allowing id's to sort chronologically (e.g. listing contents of an S3 bucket):    * 'build_id' – roughly {{$\{TIMESTAMP\}\_$\{version_id\}\_$\{build_variant\}}}  * 'task_id' – roughly {{$\{build_id\}\_$\{task_name\}}}    Following that logic, you could add a new expansion:    * 'expansion_id' – roughly {{$\{task_id\}\_$\{expansion\}}}    Then all the unique identifier expansions would build logically and consistently on each other.    That would simplify the job of users choosing an expansion for naming artifacts to S3:    * Need something to reuse across tasks for a build: use just 'build_id'  * Need some task output for external consumption (e.g. a release tarball): use just 'task_id'  * Need to save debugging output from a particular task run: use just 'execution_id'",Bug,"Major - P3",Resolved,"2017-01-26 15:53:42","2017-01-26 15:53:42",1

Right now if I need to restart a task I can add a note via the Build Baron plugin saying I restarted this task, but if I need to restart all failures in a build (EVG-429) I can't easily add a note to all the restarted tasks.    Ideally the audit log would have some filtering mechanism (like the waterfall view has) so one could type restart to see all the recent task restarts.    I think this would be useful information for the Build Baron to have, so the audit log is just a proposal. If a task restart (or cancellation, or priority change) automatically added a note visible via the BB plugin I think that would meet the requirements.","New Feature","Major - P3",Resolved,"2016-06-06 18:27:33","2016-06-06 18:27:33",2
