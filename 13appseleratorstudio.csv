"Appcelerator Studio","Studio should not rebuild workspace when a file under build directory has changed","*Summary:*  Appc Studio monitors *+all+* file changes under the project's directory tree. When any file has been added/removed/changed, it'll display Building Workspace.    Appc Studio is also monitoring the project's build subdirectory as well, when it shouldn't. This means doing an app build will trigger the Building Workspace several several times in the middle of the build process. Studio should be modified to not monitor the build subdirectory.    *Steps to reproduce:*  # Build and run a project in Studio to Android or iOS.  # Notice that Building Workspace is shown in Studio's status bar until the build ends.  # Go to your project directory in Finder or Windows Explorer.  # Go to subdirectory build/android or build/ios.  # Modify one of the build files.  # Notice that Building Workspace is shown in Studio's status bar.    *Note 1:*  The rebuilding of the workspace for project file changes is actually very fast in Studio and does not beachball the app. So, resolving this issue is more for eliminating the noise that ends up being displayed.    *Note 2:*  Perhaps Studio should ignore the Resources directory for Alloy projects as well? This is because building an Alloy app will generate files under this directory.  ",Improvement,Low,Resolved,"2019-05-29 01:14:37","2019-05-29 01:14:37",8

"Appcelerator Studio","Port 8080 remains blocked even after terminating an Arrow app running on Local Server","*Description*  In Studio, terminating an Arrow app that is running on a local server, does not kill all processes associated with that app. Specifically, port 8080 is not released, and when trying to run any Arrow app a second time, errors are printed in the console, and the app does not run. The configuration for arrow is Run Arrow with default configuration. This occurs only in Studio. For the CLI, when the local server is terminated with Ctrl-C, the app can be run again on a local server. This issue is seen on both Windows and Mac.    *Steps to reproduce*  1. Create a new Arrow app in Studio.  2. Make sure configuration is set as Run Arrow with default configuration.  3. Run the Arrow app on Local Server. This will run fine.  4. Click the red button on the bottom left to terminate execution.  5. Run the app again on Local Server.    *Result*  Errors will be printed in the console. Sometimes it says that port 8080 is not available, while other times it prints operation not permitted. In order to unblock the port, I needed to go to the command line and kill the process that matched 8080 in the process name.    *Expected Result*  When the app was terminated, it should have killed all associated process. It should not be necessary to go to the command line to kill them. Therefore when the Arrow app is run a second time, there should be no errors. On the CLI, the problem is not seen.",Bug,High,Reopened,"2017-02-17 22:59:25","2017-02-17 22:59:25",8

"Appcelerator Studio","Scoped incremental build taking too long","Hello,    Whenever we are trying to run a mobile app project in Studio, it takes a really long time (last time we had to shutdown our Mac, because it was more than 2 hours and we had to leave the office). If we check the progress tab, it says it is trying to run a scoped incremental build, and then it seems to hang on some project files. Moreover, this is not something that happens every run try, sometimes it requires a scoped incremental build and sometimes it just runs fine.     Our project has a size of almost 500 MB (17 MB are pictures).   Our app folder is small in size (only 21 MB), but the whole project folder is 500 MB (the large project size is due to titanium modules like ti.imagefactory and ti.googlemaps).  This issue wasn't happening before 20th of March, so I tried reverting to the last Appcelerator Studio version, but that didn't work either. Neither did, reinstalling Studio or rebooting the machine. We are currently using Titanium SDK 6.0.2 on our project, but SDK 6.0.1 and 6.0.3 are also not working the ideal way.    We are unsure what is causing this critical issue, but this is causing half of our machines.  ",Bug,High,Closed,"2017-04-19 22:41:29","2017-04-19 22:41:29",8

"Appcelerator Studio","Use appc daemon to request system info","Appcelerator Studio will no longer need to call {{ti info -t <platform>}} a bunch of times each minute. With the appc daemon, Studio can simply connect to the server over a WebSocket and query the system information as well as listen for changes.    The appc daemon will ship with the appc cli, so Studio will not need to worry about installing the appc daemon. However, Studio will need to make sure appcd is running before trying to connect to it. If appcd is already running, the start operation immediately returns successfully.    Note: appcd isn't guaranteed to be globally installed. You will want to manually invoke it by calling {{node /path/to/appcd start}}.    This applies to all platforms: OS X, Linux, and Windows.    Studio will need to open a WebSocket to 127.0.0.1 port 1732. Once the socket is open, it will need to send a request using the appcd protocol. It's pretty simple. To kick off a request, Studio needs to send a stringified JSON object containing a {{version}}, {{path}}, {{id}}, and optionally a {{data}} payload.    Here's the JavaScript equivalent:        The version must be {{1.0}}.    The path can be {{/system-info}} to get the info for ALL supported platforms (i.e. Android & iOS on OSX, Android & Windows on Windows, Android on Linux). The path may also contain the specific platform such as {{/system-info/ios}} or even platform specific info such as {{/system-info/ios/devices}}.    The id must be a string containing a unique request id. It can be a sequential number (cast as a string) or a UUID. The purpose of the id is that a single WebSocket can service multiple simultaneous requests and id is the only way you can match up the response with the initial request. For example, the appcd client generates a UUID for each request and then registers that UUID with an event emitter so that responses to the request ID are emitted to the code that made the request. Studio can use whatever mechanism it wishes to match responses with requests.    The data payload is optional. It's a JSON object containing additional information. It will allow Studio to specify additional request arguments and filtering options.    The response is a stringified JSON object containing an {{id}}, {{data}}, and possibly a {{status}}.    If the latest appc cli is not installed, and thus appc daemon is not installed, then Studio should continue to use the {{ti info}} method it does today.","New Feature",High,Resolved,"2016-02-04 03:58:32","2016-02-04 03:58:32",13

"Appcelerator Studio","Update Windows SDK Preference Page to use Windows Publisher ID","We've had to make a change to some of the config/command line values we use for Windows SDK.    Basically before there was a Windows Phone Publisher GUID (-G) that was required. We ended up never actually using that, and it was a holdover from the Win 8 Mobile Web hybrid app stuff. Now that value and config value are optional, not required. It's used to specify the old Windows 8 publisher ID that MS assigned you, in the scenario that you're publishing an upgraded version of the app for Win 8.1/10.    There's now a sister config value/option called the WIndows Phone product id for the same upgraded 8->8.1 app scenario. It's to specify the old Win 8 app id. see https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/wpProductId.js  Again that's optional. I think it's ok to not surface either of these two config/command line options because they'd be used extremely rarely by our customers. (plus one is more global - the Win 8 publisher GUID, while the other is app-specific - the Windows Phone product id).    The important change is likely to make the pref page handle showing/editing the new Windows publisher Id config value now (in place of the Windows Phone Publisher GUID we discussed above that it currently surfaces). It's defined for the CLi here: https://github.com/sgtcoolguy/titanium_mobile_windows/blob/master/cli/commands/_build/config/winPublisherId.js  It's stored in the ti CLI config key windows.publisherId, and can be specified on the comm,and line with the --win-publisher-id or -I switch.

"Appcelerator Studio","Android modules are not recognized as Java projects","h3. Summary  As of the release of Titanium (& Studio) 3.3.0, old Android modules project had to be recreated (the structure having changed, the new build scripts wouldn't build an project created previously).    However, new projects, even though they build through the script, are not proper Java projects anymore and can not be worked on via Titanium Studio. Even when imported in ADT they are pure text projects and no autocompletion or syntax validation is available anymore.    h3. How to reproduce  Having properly installed the following SDKS :   Android 4.4.2, Android 4.1.2, Android 2.3.3  And having the NDK installed and properly configured in studio.    From an empty workspace, when you create a new Android module (in the example named bob, with id com.bob), everything seems to work fine, no errors are displayed during the creation and you now get a structure where source files are in android/src/com/bob folder :    !AndroidModuleBug.png!    The Java files no longer appear as part of a *package*.  There are *no jar* dependencies shown.  It's not even a *proper Java project* anymore.    I have removed a ; in the screenshot to show that the *syntax validation* didn't pick it up.  When using *autocomplete*, you get the following message (cf. screenshot) This compilation unit is not on the build path of a Java project.    When removing the fake syntax error, the module packages fine, however it can no longer be worked on properly : no proper Java editing, have to guess all the fields.    I have reinstalled Titanium Studio from scratch to make sure it was not related to a problem in the update mechanism.    This is a complete nightmare for me since I have no longer the capability of editing my Android modules on my projects.",Bug,High,Closed,"2014-08-12 10:39:58","2014-08-12 10:39:58",5

"Appcelerator Studio","Studio Formatter behaves incorrectly causing JSHint errors","I have noticed that the formatter used within the Studio application has a number of issues that are causing me and my team a lot of difficulties when working with different tools and attempting to maintain a high level of code quality.    1. Studio reformats functions and var declarations within functions incorrectly. I say incorrect as it can cause JSHint errors afterwards also existing formatting applied, say by developer A, gets reformatted by Studio when developer B edits the documents.    Here is an example of a small function example that has been formatted with Sublime Text 2 and passes JSHint. It is also the style that I wish to use, which also is recommended in many books regarding code quality with JavaScript.    {code:title=FormattingCorrect.js|borderStyle=solid}  /**   * Test File for Appcelerator Studio Formatting Bug   *   * @author <USER>  */    /**   * Example Function that maintains a space after the function parantheses and the braces.   * variable declaration within is indented for readibility and also allows for git merges   * to be easily reviewed. The   *   * use strict; is used internally and is another issue when the Studio foramtter is used,   *  it throws errors when using JSLint and should respect certain code style guide conventions.   *   */    function exampleFunction() {      use strict;      var myVar1,          myVar2,          myVar3;        switch (myVar1) {      case true:          myVar3 = true;          break;      case false:          myVar3 = false;          break;      default:          myVar3 = null;      }      Ti.API.log(myVar1 + myVar2 + myVar3);  }    exports.exampleFunction = exampleFunction;      The case should be indented with the switch, the vars should stay on a newline and the use strict; should not move.    This raises a wider question as why we can't use JSBeautifer rules/tags for certain settings. The formatting options and rules probably would better serve us if they adopted more of this standard approach that is more widely adopted. (just an idea).    My main issue is this current reformatting.

The same controller structure is mirrored for the styles and the views.    Now, when you open a controller, style or view that is not directly sitting in the folders app/controllers/, app/styles/ or app/views/, then you will not be able to use the new simplified navigation to open the other related files. The option will be greyed out.    It would be nice to have that use case supported.  ",Improvement,High,Closed,"2014-02-24 22:11:27","2014-02-24 22:11:27",8

For instance, Java 1.6.X only ships with SHA1withRSA, so there should be a signature drop down list that has only SHA1withRSA selected.    Java 1.7.X ships both SHA1withRSA and SHA256withRSA, so there should be a signature drop down list for both signatures.    By having this option when creating an Android keystore, a user can:     1. Package their app to a non-KitKat (< 4.4) device using only the SHA1withRSA signature  2. Package their app to a KitKat device with either SHA1withRSA *or* SHA256withRSA.

It should be prepended by 'Version' or 'SDK'.    3) Remove the gap between separators : When the advance details is expanded, the gap between details section and separator should be avoided.    4) Expand the details section to cover all the width.    5) Hide the Advanced Details button/label incase if the platform has nothing to display in the details section.    6) If the SDK location path is very big, then wizard is expanded to wide enough to show the complete path.

"Appcelerator Studio","Add diagnostic tests for troubleshooting npm configuration issues","If any user has npm installation issues either with or without prefix configured, then it might not be very easy to judge the problem on the user's machine, especially with npm prefix configuration.    Instead of asking user each time to run a series of commands on their machine to figure out the underlying problem, we can add those commands in the diagnostic tests and that should let us give a fair idea on what is going on user's machine with just the diagnostic test logs.    When the NPM updates are invoked, either during startup or by the user -    1) It verifies whether the package is installed on the machine using 'npm -g ls <package>' command.  1.1) If the above command fails for any reason, then invokes 'npm -p ls -g'  2) If the package is available on the machine, it figures out the installed version and latest available version using 'npm view <package> version' command.    Also, since PREFIX is one of those dark areas, we need to add the prefix configuration to the diagnostic logs.    1) Environment variable : Get the system property for NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX  2) Get the prefix key from the npm configuration : npm config get prefix  3) If only the environment variable is set, then the local prefix config value differs from the global one. That can lead to discrepancies in the installation of npm packages. So we should get the output for : 'sudo npm config get prefix'. However, since we don't hold user's password, this might not be a feasible value to store in the diagnostic tests.",Improvement,High,Closed,"2013-08-23 02:45:13","2013-08-23 02:45:13",5

The result is that the Project is now marked with the red/white error icon and the 'Errors in Workspace' alert is displayed every time the project is being build.     'Resources' folder is by default not visible for Alloy projects on Studio, so the default result is also that the project is marked with an error icon, but the user can't see any other red error icon next to any visible Project file.

Additionally, those files are contributed to the list run through our builder for a project. So they get merged into the project's index itself. For each build entry we should be able to point at a single file or a directory tree, and then index all of it. Each entry should be recorded into it's own index file, so multiple projects referencing the same entry can reuse the same index (i.e. Titanium SDK 2.1.4GA API).

"Appcelerator Studio","TiApp Editor: prompt to save when focus leaves tiapp editor","Android Device Debugger: debug drop-down menu fails to list device option if tiapp.xml is dirty yet has a valid SDK.    For instance, if a project has SDK 2.1.2 selected in the tiapp.xml and the xml is saved, then the tiapp.xml sdk version is changed to 3.0.0 but not saved, the debug to device option is not available under Debug > Android Device until the tiapp.xml is saved. There are probably many edge cases surrounding this issue. We are reading the tiapp.xml that is saved, not the one in memory (OR we should just list all run options by default because there is already an invalid config error, see screenshot 'Correct Error'). This is a usability issue.    Steps to Reproduce:    1. Create a new project with the SDK set to a version such as 2.1.2.GA or lower (pre-device debugging support).  2. In the project tiapp.xml, change the sdk without saving to a version such as 3.0.0.X or higher (sdk w/device debugging support).  3. Go to Debug > Android Device.    Actual Result:    Android Device is not there because the tiapp.xml is not saved.    See Screenshot 'Usability'.    Expected Result:    The Android Device entry should exist, and the tiapp.xml should be prompted for save before deployment.     Note: There is currently an error pop-up if device debugging is attempted on an sdk below 2.2, so the current implementation already has a safeguard.

We can now include a deprecation message along with the version number in the YML docs, and it would be good if we could convey that through JSCA. We actually have three keys in the YAML:    Obviously, we shouldn't prompt for APIs that have been removed. We could omit these from the JSCA, or add a new annotation to the JSCA so you can post an appropriate message.    Ingo said we'd need to rev the JSCA version number to change deprecated from a boolean to dict to accomplish this.    When a new version is available, we can update the JSCA generator.    * Create version 1.1 of the JSCA format that supports an expanded deprecated flag. It may be that we can also creatively update the existing fields, i.e. place the deprecation notes in the main description, and just add a removed field, like the since we already have.  * If an item is deprecated in the JSCA, we should display an appropriate warning in content assist. It may also be that we have a flag _not_ to show deprecated items by default  * Deprecated items should prompt a warning in both the editor gutter and the problems view, ideally with a note indicating what the replacement is.

Studio should check for the JAVA_HOME before beginning a build, check if it is correctly set, and if it is missing or incorrect pass in a correct version into the build.

Proposed Solution(s)    It would be good if you could specify by default whether you want to use the x86 or standard emulator for all projects, perhaps in {{Preferences -> Titanium Studio -> Titanium}}. It should be the standard emulator by default as the x86 emulator currently does not include the Google APIs (which would prevent the KitchenSink from running) and it does not support V8, as detailed in the linked ticket.    Also, it should be configurable on a per-project basis as well, for the same reasons I listed in the above paragraph.    So:    # We need to upgrade our AVI detection to show the available ABIs per device  # For devices with multiple ABIs we need to allow the user to select which one to use as part of the launch configuration, and that is passed as the first argument to the SDK for SDKs 2.1+. For < 2.1, we only pass the device argument  # We could add a preference in Titanium Preferences to default to x86 or standard emulator (were available).

Second, the three letters used to signify iPad and iPhone are difficult to decipher: iPa and iPh.  2) While most OSes have the header in white, Linux is grey, making the Android icon difficult to make out as the contrast is too low.    An additional concern may be the sourcing of the icons    Steps to reproduce:  1) Install Studio 2.0 on any system (linux for Android icon contrast evaluation)  2) Create a new project  3) Edit the TiApp.xml  4) Note the Module section in the editor overview    Result:  Icons less than ideal    Expected:  Icons are beautiful",Improvement,Medium,Closed,"2012-03-05 17:15:06","2012-03-05 17:15:06",5

Don't worry about fleshing them out fully. Instead, take Chris's feedback and Thomas's feedback (shown below) to create a set of test scenarios at the top of the file and run through those. We will leave the creation of exhaustive test cases to later when we have more QA resources.  * Review the unit tests. See if they exercise the functionality. Run them through Emma to check for code coverage  * Run the test scenarios and file any bugs found.    To Test:  Checkout the participant branch of studio3, studio3-ruby and studio3-php    Thomas's feedback:  * All tests are marked as full. The point of a test plan is to break functionality into smoke, acceptance and full levels of test. If the tester can't figure out these coverage levels, they need to work with dev to figure it out.  * Resource requirements are not filled out - now way of knowing from this plan what Os are being tested or targeted  * An actual description of what Build Participant functionality is would be helpful if the test plan is going to be run by anyone other than the author. There seems to be multiple features in the test cases  * No risks or assumptions are filled out  * Often missing set up steps - For the PHP and Ruby specific test cases, how do we setup our environment to test those test cases?  * Under genericized tests, it says Applicable to all languages.

"Appcelerator Studio","Allow users to add new platform targets after project creation ","Description:  While testing studio, it was noted that new deployment targets could not be added to an existing project. For example, a project created for an Android deployment had the iOS targets grayed out.    It is possible to manually edit TiApp.xml to set targets to true. This enables the run on simulator for iOS, and in my test was able to launch the project in the simulator.     Steps to reproduce:  1) Create a new Titanium Mobile project in Studio  2) Select Android as the only deployment target  3) When the project is created, open TiApp.xml and note that only Android is available to select/deselect  4) Open the pure xml tab of TiApp.xml and set deploy target for iOS to true    Result:  Your project can be launched in the simulator, but installed on device will launch then quit and has no icon.    Expected:  Either no ability to add or remove targets after project creation or the ability to add with the same default structure as during project creation.    Suggested solution:    * user checks platform option in tiapp.xml  * Call platform script to initialize new platform. This would (most likely) add another build folder, and copy several resources into a specific location  * Update tiapp.xml with reference to new platform  * Validate project specifics as per what we would do in the new project wizard  * Suggest we don't _remove_ platform support...alerting the user we can't remove platform support for a project if they try to uncheck a box.",Improvement,High,Closed,"2011-06-10 18:03:26","2011-06-10 18:03:26",13
