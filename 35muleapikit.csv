"Mule APIkit","jackson-core is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).","{{jackson-core}} is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). The {{_reportInvalidToken()}} function in the {{UTF8StreamJsonParser}} and {{ReaderBasedJsonParser}} classes allows large amounts of extraneous data to be printed to the server log. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a POST request containing large amounts of data. When the data contains invalid JSON, an exception is thrown, which results in the consumption of available disk space when the error message is written to {{server.log}} along with the request data.  Detection  The application is vulnerable by using this component.  Recommendation  We recommend upgrading to a version of this component that is not vulnerable to this specific issue.

"Mule APIkit","jackson-databind is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE)","h3. Vulnerability Information  Issue  [CVE-2017-7525|http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2017-7525]  Source  National Vulnerability Database  Severity  Sonatype CVSS 3.0: 8.1  Weakness  Sonatype CWE: [502|https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html]  Description from CVE  Reserved CVE.  Explanation  {{jackson-databind}} is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE). The {{createBeanDeserializer()}} function in the {{BeanDeserializerFactory}} class allows untrusted Java objects to be deserialized. A remote attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious serialized object that will result in RCE if the application attempts to deserialize it.  Detection  The application is vulnerable by using this component, when default typing is enabled.    Note: Spring Security has provided their own fix for this vulnerability ([CVE-2017-4995|https://pivotal.io/security/cve-2017-4995]). If this component is being used as part of Spring Security, then you are not vulnerable if you are running Spring Security 4.2.3.RELEASE or greater for 4.x or Spring Security 5.0.0.M2 or greater for 5.x.  Recommendation  There is no non vulnerable version of this component. Despite there being a fix provided by Jackson, it uses a black-list approach. If there is another class not black-listed which performs deserialization on the classpath, then this may lead to code execution. We recommend investigating alternative components or a potential mitigating control.    Workaround: Do not use the default typing. Instead you will need to implement your own.  {quote}It is also possible to customize global defaulting, using ObjectMapper.setDefaultTyping(…) – you just have to implement your own TypeResolverBuilder (which is not very difficult); and by doing so, can actually configure all aspects of type information. Builder itself is just a short-cut for building actual handlers.  {quote}  Reference: [https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonPolymorphicDeserialization]    Examples of implementing your own typing can be found by looking at [Spring Security's fix|https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/commit/947d11f433b78294942cb5ea56e8aa5c3a0ca439] or [this Stack Overflow article|https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12353774/how-to-customize-jackson-type-information-mechanism].

Mule is working on this issue https://www.mulesoft.org/jira/browse/MULE-13756. It has an application that reproduces the problem.  Notice that the mule-artifact.json does not list any file:      attributes: {        exportedResources: [],        exportedPackages: []      }   but when starting apikit, the file api.raml inside of resources is retrieved.    After mule fixes this problem, the module will continue working only if the mule-artifact.json file is correctly generated. This means that the fix, on the apikit side, has to be done only in the archetype and the scaffolder. The actual code of the module will be able to handle the change.    The scaffolder will have to regenerate the mule-artifact.json file each time that the user introduces a change into the resources folder (by adding or deleting a file)    ",Bug,Critical,Closed,"2017-10-11 20:31:14","2017-10-11 19:31:14",2
