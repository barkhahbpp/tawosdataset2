"Atlassian Jira Server","Migrating JIRA server documentation update for data restore","Currently within the doc [Migrating JIRA applications to another server - Atlassian Documentation|https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver073/migrating-jira-applications-to-another-server-861253107.html] has the steps of:  {quote}  3.6 Import your old data into your new JIRA applications    After you have started your new JIRA installation you should be logged in to your JIRA application, and ready to import the data from your old instance into the new instance. You will need the backup file of data from your old JIRA that you created earlier in these instructions ( above).    To import your old JIRA data into your new JIRA:    # Log in as a user with the 'JIRA System Administrators' global permission.  # Select Administration > System > Import & Export > Restore System (tab) to open the 'Restore JIRA data from Backup' page.  # In the File name field, specify the XML backup file you created previously during the export process (above). That zipped file should contain two xml files: activeobjects.xml and entities.xml. Both of these files must be included in the zipped file for the import process to work.  # Restore the attachments directory that you backed up previously, into the attachments directory of your new JIRA. (See Restoring data.)      (info) Avoid passing through a proxy when performing an XML restore, especially if your JIRA instance is very large. Using a proxy may cause timeout errors.   {quote}    But this is not actually what happens here.  If you follow all these step up to this point, when you start JIRA, you won't actually be logged into JIRA at all (how could you, the database is totally empty at this point).  When you start JIRA with an empty data as was the steps of this doc, you start JIRA in the initial setup wizard.  From here you can actually click the link for 'import existing data' and then simply select the XML backup here to restore.    That part is a minor difference but I would like to clarify that first.   In order to follow the steps in the current guide, you would need to create a new admin account and finish the initial setup wizard of JIRA before you can gain access to the System -> Restore data option.  Which is just misleading.    Also there is a bigger problem with following these steps if you are also upgrading JIRA at this time.  If you follow these current steps, and JIRA is upgraded to a new version where the naming convention of attachments has changed (I know it has happened between 6.4 and 7.0, and again in 7.2), then following these steps will result in your previous attachments in JIRA being inaccessible to you in the new instance because the database references for these files in the {{fileattachments}} table get updated with the new naming convention when the XML import happens, but the actual flat files themselves are not in place in order for JIRA to rename them yet.  Leaving the customer with broken attachments that are actually a pain to fix and additional support cases waiting to happen.      Instead I would recommend these steps:      {panel:borderStyle=dashed| borderColor=#3C78B5| titleBGColor=#3C78B5| bgColor=#E7F4FA}    3.6 Import your old data into your new JIRA applications    After you have started your new JIRA installation you will notice that JIRA will launch its initial setup wizard.   This happens anytime JIRA starts with an empty database.  From here you can import your backup file in order to populate your XML backup data into your new empty database. You will need the backup file of data from your old JIRA that you created earlier in these instructions ( above).    To import your old JIRA data into your new JIRA:    # Restore the attachments directory that you backed up previously, into the attachments directory of your new JIRA. (See Restoring data.)  # Start JIRA  # In the setup wizard select the option for 'Import existing data'  # In the File name field, specify the XML backup file you created previously during the export process (above).

For example:   Let's say that your TEST project has the last issue key *TEST-4321*.     The directory id created by JIRA will be *10000* until the issue key *TEST-10001* is created so JIRA will create the new directory id *20000*.     To fix this basically, we'll have to check for each project that has an issue key above 10001 like below:  ||Directory id||10000||20000||30000||40000||50000||  ||Issue key|1 ~ 10.000|10.001 ~ 20.000|20.001 ~ 30.000|30.001 ~ 40.000|40.001 ~ 50.000|      We found this external article with great informations about this: [Handling millions of attachments in JIRA|http://blog.valiantys.com/en/jira-en/million-jira-issues].",Suggestion,,Closed,"2017-01-04 19:11:19","2017-01-04 19:11:19",4

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59713].   {panel}  The documentation for JIRA Software 7.0's Project Import tool, at [https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver070/restoring-a-project-from-backup-749383456.html], lacks clarity when it comes to importing Agile-style JIRA projects.  Please revise the documentaiton to address the following four issues, numbered A, B, C & D:    A) When importing JIRA Agile projects from one JIRA Software 7.0 system to another, the user is in a Catch-22 situation regarding workflows.  The Project Import documentation states:    {color:#14892c}If you wish to retain a customized workflow from your backup, you will need to create a new workflow in your target JIRA instance and manually edit the new workflow (e.g. create steps and transitions) to reflect your old workflow   . . .  Do not use the JIRA functionality for exporting and importing workflow XML definitions, to copy your backup workflow to your target JIRA instance.  {color}    However, when it comes to Aglie projects, the workflow itself contains comments which contradict the above documentation:    {color:#654982}This workflow is managed internally by JIRA Agile. Do not manually modify this workflow{color}    Please provide clarification what to do specifically regarding workflows when importing Agile-style projects:    1) Should the workflow be recreated manually?  2) Should the workflow be exported as XML, then imported on the target system and manually revised?  3) Or is it best to use the workflow that is created when the empty project is first created on the target system?    B) When creating the new empty projects on the target system, is it OK to create a non-Agile project, then later associate the project with an Agile workflow?  Or must the new empty projects be created as Agile projects from the start (via an Agile-enabled project template)?    C) I often assign the same workflow to multiple non-Aglie projects.  Is it possible for Agile projects to have shared workflows?  Or must each Agile project have a distinct workflow?    D) Please provide some sample SQL queries that could be used to re-establish Boards and other Agile data that the JIRA Software 7.0 Import Tool currently skips.  So far, the best procedure I have found is at [https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/18448856/how-to-import-jira-agile-sprint-data-project-by-project], but there is no way for me to know whether these steps are correct and complete.

[See the corresponding suggestion|http://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JRACLOUD-59424].   {panel}  As per costumer feedback:  {quote}  It may be better to exclude the whole /jira-home/caches/ directory all together, as it looks like this is just temporary content as well as the indexes. There is also the tmp folder, which looks to be the same kind of thing. I'd guess those two locations are the most likely to be modified during a copy.    I've tried copying the HOME folder without either of those two directories (using exclude commands in rsync) and Jira actually starts up fine without them. It re-creates them when it first runs and starts to fill them with content again. The index page says that the index is missing and that it should be restored and re-built; re-creating it only took 6 minutes or our test system.    I think it would be very good to update the documentation in light of all this. Right now, it says create a snapshot of the data directory (including all files and subdirectories), then back up the snapshot:    https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/backing-up-data-185729581.html    I think it would be better and clearer to say:    The recommended method of backing up the data directory is to copy it to another location while excluding both the /jira-data/caches/ and /jira-data/tmp folders, and then to archive the copied folder (using zip, tar.gz, etc). This is because the content in those two folders is frequently modified, which may cause the copy to fail, and because Jira will simply re-create these folders and their content if they are missing.    NOTE: the Jira index is stored inside the caches directory, so will be lost using this method. You can enable restorable index in the system options to create backups of the index, which you can then restore later. Alternatively, if time is available, you can re-create the index from scratch after you have restored Jira.    Here is an example rsync command for the copy:    rsync -avh --delete --exclude 'caches' --exclude 'tmp' --stats --progress /jira-data/ /jira-rsync/        That would definately have helped me when I was configuring the backup.  {quote}",Suggestion,,Closed,"2016-01-18 09:00:49","2016-01-18 09:00:49",4

One could expect that passing the param would result in replacing deleted group with swapped group in all schemes (permission, notification, issue security) but also comments and worklogs where you restricted visibility. Which is not true. The group is swapped only for comments and worklogs. Someone decided that visibility restrictions stands only for these two entities. However you do restrict visibility of an issue by setting its security level, don't you?    Probably we can't change behaviour of the resource (it's part of API) and underlying GroupService, but we can at least document it better, as is the GroupService#deleteGroup documented, so it's clear what will get swapped.    We'd also consider retiring GroupService#deleteGroup and DELETE /group?swapGroup behaviour in favour of swapping groups in comments and worklogs but also all schemes, which will make it consistent with RoleService and DELETE /role implementation, which (will) swap role in comments, worklogs, and schemes.

Using *JIRA Cloud*?

The standalone installation of JIRA does not require changing the JDBC driver if JIRA is not WAR (Connecting JIRA to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL]), but the [Supported Platforms|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/DOC/Supported+Platforms] document says or seems to say that he DB version should match the JDBC version. This information is causing some noise at the customers and took me some time to understand what should I do. I think is important to clear this out to reduce this friction.       I'm not sure about the solution. Maybe is recommend leave the old JDBC 9.0 with newer versions of Postgres since this is the bundle driver or is recommend follow the JIRA war process to install the JDBC new driver. The comment from James Rice (at references below) resumes this inconsistence.          References for this request:     * Issue [JSP-231367|https://support.atlassian.com/browse/JSP-231367];     * James Rice comment at Jan 28, 2015 from [Connecting JIRA to PostgreSQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Connecting+JIRA+to+PostgreSQL] page.

I know from the advanced usage that some custom fields can be added using custom JavaScript and I assume that fields such as Due Date can also be added, but I'm not sure.    Please also see the discussion on this at https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/79461/issue-adding-custom-fields-to-issue-collector-template    To reproduce:    # Added Due Date and Linked Issues to the Default screen.  # Checked that Due Date and Linked Issues were not hidden in the field configuration  # Checked Permission Scheme: Allowed 'Anyone' to Schedule Issues, Allowed 'Anyone' to Link Issues  # Went to create an issue collector   Made issue collector for my TEST project  Chose to collect issues as Bugs   choose Custom for Issue Template Form     Result - The Due Date and Linked Issues fields are not available in the custom form  ",Suggestion,,Closed,"2013-07-17 19:22:23","2013-07-17 19:22:23",4
"Atlassian Jira Server","JIRA REST does not return errors on transitioning an issue","The outcome of the transition is ignored, and all we get back is an empty 204 response.    REST:      This code is taken from: https://atlaseye.atlassian.com/browse/jira-rest/jira-rest-plugin/src/main/java/com/atlassian/jira/rest/v2/issue/UpdateIssueResource.java?r=8c7d68606c899d4f781431ddfda4fd9ee499120a      Action (called from JIRA UI):      This means that FishEye / Stash cannot detect when things go wrong when transitioning an issue.    Additionally, the response we get back even in the success case is empty. It would be very nice to be given the expandable issue object so that we dont need a second request to get the new state + transitions.    We will be implementing the following workaround:  * make the transition  * re-retrieve the issue  * check that the to state of the transition is equal to the new state of the issue  * if it is not, display a generic error message that something went wrong in JIRA    Is there anything wrong with this workaround?",Bug,Low,Closed,"2013-07-16 03:19:41","2013-07-16 03:19:41",2

Also, on the 'Manage Filters' or 'Manage Dashboards' screen they are displayed as 'Shared with all users' which strengthens the belief that it is only shared with internal users.
