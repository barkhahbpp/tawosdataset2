The core of what’s causing this to come up more is that it’s emerging as a common pattern to test sync with an emulator + Compass/Explorer.  However, as replace is being used when someone makes a change offline on an emulator and then changes in our tools the emulator update is overwritten even if the updates were to separate fields.    We’re still seeing the issue we talked about before around testing Triggers, but this new case is even less intuitive for users.  {quote}    h3.

If I set that to monkey, then the thinks that the application monkey dev is connecting. We should not allow the user to change that value, we should always override it with our application name before connecting to the server  * why when I switch between connection string mode to form mode do I see a progress indicator ( [^switch.mov] ), even when I did not paste any connect string in?

"MongoDB Compass ","Eliminate multiple keychain password requests","The multiple keychain password prompt has been a long-running unexplained behavior we haven't been able to get to the bottom of. A roll-up of bug reports:    - COMPASS-1767  - COMPASS-3091  - COMPASS-3147  - COMPASS-3215    My hunch after re-reading these tickets is this happens after an auto-update or a manual upgrade. What's most likely is that we simply need to call {{keytar}} methods from the main process via ipc rather than from the renderer as we do today. [See this example on stackoverflow|https://stackoverflow.com/a/43239854].    [From this blog post|https://medium.com/cameron-nokes/how-to-securely-store-sensitive-information-in-electron-with-node-keytar-51af99f1cfc4]:    {quote}  One other important note: I recommend you only call node-keytar from the main process. If you set a password from the main process and then attempt to get it from a renderer process, it’ll prompt a permissions dialog for the user (this is macOS only, Windows doesn’t seem to mind either way). Additionally, I think it’s cleaner and clearer to the user if the access control list has your app name and it’s icon, instead of MyApp Helper and the generic app icon which is what you get when a renderer sets it.  {quote}          More notes from previous tickets rolled up below.    ---    [{{SecKeychainFindGenericPassword}}|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1397301-seckeychainfindgenericpassword?language=objc], which is the method [{{keytar}} uses to read a stored connection password|https://github.com/atom/node-keytar/blob/master/src/keytar_mac.cc#L107]. In the discussion:    {quote}  This function automatically calls the function [{{SecKeychainUnlock}}|https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/1400341-seckeychainunlock?language=objc] to display the Unlock Keychain dialog box if the keychain is currently locked.  {quote}    A few ideas on what might need to happen:    - Maybe something in the keytar bindings is too specific?   Maybe when we run app-migrations today, macOS needs to re-validate or something?  - Maybe a bulk-read call to fetch all passwords with {{FindPassword}} would guarantee this unlock dialog is shown once and only once in all cases (a single, implicit {{SecKeychainUnlock}} call), but there are some potential security implications to consider.

Issue 2  See COMPASS-1764    Example with 110,592 fields (48^3):    !perf.crazy_keys_48.png|thumbnail!     h4. Issue 3  As rendering can take a long time, the naive fix here is to let the user know it can take a long time with a rendering/loading text or spinner, depending on whether the UI is locked.    Aside: Longer term, getting field-based updates to work would allow the user to project only the fields they care about and then update just those fields, but there are no current plans to implement this.    Aside 2: This issue only affects edit mode, where the user has double-clicked on the specific field they wish to edit. Specifically clone, loading, cancel, update success and delete can all drop back to rendering just 25 fields, as they have no specific requirement to maintain the user's current context, and so are not affected.

"MongoDB Compass ","Compass handles the crazy keys document series","h4. Usage/steps to reproduce        Then navigate to the {{perf.crazy_keys}} collection in Compass.    An extended set of documents can be created and imported into MongoDB with this script relatively easily, on my local machine I already have the following numbers of keys and preliminary results:  32^3=32,768  48^3=110,592   64^3=262,144 (slow, ~5-10s)  80^3=512,000 (slow, ~30s)  96^3=884,736  140^3=2,744,000 (Compass 1.9.x betas crash with a memory exception)    h4. Proposed solution - cap at 100k fields    #intellectualhonesty - let the data drive your decision.    Thus Compass, most likely in [mongodb-schema|https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-schema], should stop scanning at about 100k fields (configurable as other optimizations are found) in a document and report this Easter egg in the GUI (originally this was Issue 2 in COMPASS-1901).    h4. Acceptance criteria    * A mongoimport -able version of these documents, perhaps with easier to understand names like crazy_keys_512000 (might be already done by COMPASS-1766, if so drop up to 2 story points)  * Cap field or schema processing at 100k fields, reporting this somehow, e.g. with properties such as totalFieldCount, analyzedFieldCount (working titles to capture the semantic, change the syntax as needed).  * Message displaying this scenario, e.g. 100,000 fields limit reached, remaining N fields are not displayed  * Appropriate unit tests    h4. Out of scope    * Anything in the schema/indexes/document validation tabs (such as the react-select dropdown to choose an index name), this is just about the Documents Tab.    h4. Background    So I let Friday afternoon get to me and challenged myself to create a document with ~2.7 million keys.    After about 3 minutes, Compass crashes. The mongo shell is still doing something in CPU-land after 8 minutes so far.    On different data sets, such as documents with ~500,000 fields (i.e. COMPASS-1766), Compass takes ~30 seconds or more to render, or crashes (COMPASS-1764).     Would explicitly limiting Compass to say 100,000 fields with a message like Compass cannot render documents with more than 100,000 fields seem reasonable? Yes but only when the user gets down to the 100,001st field.    For documents under 100k fields, is a loading spinner enough? (i.e. ~6 seconds, so should not need a progress bar?).

This behavior got lost in the transition to the React version of the schema in the 1.4.0-beta cycle.    We want to re-implement it, and also add subtle visual feedback that indiciates to the user that they have reached/passed the threshold between open/close ranges (e.g. a faded background to the side when switching to open range).    The implementation for this behavior is available in the old code base, but it needs to be adjusted to the new query builder code.     Code Snippets:    - Detection of mouse outside chart in the old code base: https://github.com/10gen/compass/blob/1.3-releases/src/app/minicharts/d3fns/many.js#L89-L98 ({{openLeft}}, {{openRight}} boolean flags)    - Code in the old Query Builder to handle open ranges: https://github.com/10gen/compass/blob/1.3-releases/src/app/minicharts/querybuilder.js#L292-L306 (probably not relevant, just adding for completeness).    - Somewhere in here we need to add the outside chart detection and construct the open query, and pass it to the {{setRangeValue}} action, see below. https://github.com/10gen/compass/blob/master/src/internal-packages/schema/lib/d3/many.js#L85-L108    - New Query Builder action {{setRangeValue}} already supports open ranges, just need to be called correctly: https://github.com/10gen/compass/blob/f05b3acf40fe9e56691aedd83cd7d970a9a84420/src/internal-plugins/query/lib/store/query-store.js#L564-L593    Acceptance criteria:  * add outside chart implementation for minicharts  * call {{setRangeValue}} in query store         ",Task,"Major - P3",Closed,"2016-09-12 02:16:50","2016-09-12 01:16:50",3
"MongoDB Compass ","As a developer I want to show dates in server time and not local (laptop) time","h5. Story  As a developer, I want Compass to show date values in server time and not converted to the local (laptop) time so that I confirm that my application is saving dates correctly.    h5. User anecdote  More details:  With the current Compass implementation, I thought my App inserts dates with an offset of +1 day and I spent a lot of time trouble-shooting until I used the mongo shell and realized the dates are correct but Compass shows it converted to local time.    h5.
